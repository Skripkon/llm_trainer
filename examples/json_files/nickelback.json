path less traveled by\nThat first step you take is the longest stride If today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday?\nWould you live each moment like your last?\nLeave old pictures in the past\nDonate every dime you have?\nIf today was your last day\n(If today was your last day) Against the grain should be a way of life\nWhat's worth the prize is always worth the fight\nEvery second counts 'cause there's no second try\nSo live like you'll never live it twice\nDon't take the free ride in your own life If today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday?\nWould you live each moment like your last?\nLeave old pictures in the past\nDonate every dime you have?\nWould you call old friends you never see?\nReminisce old memories\nWould you forgive your enemies?\nWould you find that one you're dreamin' of?\nSwear up and down to God above\nThat you finally fall in love\nIf today was your last day If today was your last day\nWould you make your mark by mending a broken heart?\nYou know it's never too late to shoot for the stars\nRegardless of who you are\nSo do whatever it takes\nCause you can't rewind a moment in this life\nLet nothin' stand in your way\nCause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday?\nWould you live

find that one you're dreamin' of?\nSwear up and down to God above\nThat you finally fall in love\nIf today was your last day How the hell'd we wind up like this\nWhy weren't we able\nTo see the signs

standing here with you\nSo I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end\nIs it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there\n'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares\nSomeone to love with my life in their hands\nThere's gotta be somebody for me like that\n'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own\nAnd everyone wants to know they're not alone\nThere's somebody else that feels the same somewhere\nThere's gotta be somebody for me out there You can't give up, (when you're looking for)\nA diamond in the rough ('cause you

someone cares\nSomeone to love with my life in their hands\nThere's gotta be somebody for me, oh Nobody wants to go it on their own\nAnd everyone wants to know they're not alone\nThere's somebody else that feels the same somewhere\nThere's gotta be somebody for me out there\nNobody wants to be the last one there\n'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares\nThere's somebody else that feels the same somewhere\nThere's gotta be somebody for me out there Prison gates won't open up for me\nOn these hands and knees I'm crawlin'\nOh, I reach for you, well I'm terrified of these four walls\nThese iron bars can't hold my soul in\nAll I need is you, come please, I'm callin'\nAnd, oh, I scream for you\nHurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like\nTo be the last one standing\nAnd teach me wrong from right\nAnd I'll show you what I can be\nSay it for me, say it to me\nAnd I'll leave this life behind me\nSay it if it's worth saving me Heaven's gates won't open up for me\nWith these broken wings I'm fallin' and all I see is you\nThese city walls ain't got no love for me\nI'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story\nAnd, oh, I scream for you come please,\nI'm callin' and all I need from you, hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like\nTo be the last one standing\nAnd teach me wrong from right\nAnd I'll show you what I can be\nSay it for me, say it to me\nAnd I'll

feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track\nI'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride\nBecause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight\nI'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out\nI got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run\nYour mom don't know that you were missing\nShe'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you\nThat I've been kissing\nScreamin' No, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nJust acting like we're animals\nNo, no matter where we go\n'Cause everybody knows\nWe're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in\nGet in, just get in\nCheck out the trouble we're in You're beside me on the seat\nGot your hand between my knees\nAnd you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze\nIt's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear\nBut I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears\nBy now, no doubt that we were heading south\nI guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth\n'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch\nIt felt so good I almost drove into the ditch\nI'm screamin' No, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nJust acting like we're animals\nNo, no matter where we go\n'Cause everybody knows\nWe're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in\nGet in, just get in\nLook at the trouble we're in We were parked out by the tracks\nWe're sitting in the back\nAnd we just started getting busy\nWhen she whispered what was that\nThe wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are\nAnd that was when she started screamin'\nThat's my dad outside the car\nOh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition\nMust have wound up on the floor while\nWe were switching our positions\nI guess they knew that she was missing\nAs I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing\nScreamin' No, we're never gonna quit\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nJust acting like we're animals\nNo, no matter where we go\n'Cause everybody knows\nWe're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in\nWe're just a couple of animals\nGet in, just get in\nAin't nothing wrong with it\nCheck out the trouble we're in\nWe're just a couple of animals\nGet in, just get in Lying awake, did it again for Christ sake\nShoulda told her to go, and I know it\nBut she tasted like home\nYeah, she tasted like home\nI did what I did, can't stay in and I'm just a kid\nSaw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it\n'Cause you tasted like home\nYeah, she tasted like home Oh well, home ain't what I'm callin'\nBut I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways\nThe pain gets so much clearer\nWhen the one to blame is standing in the mirror\nThis fool, this life\nLit a match and set his life on fire\nI guess I'd rather be alone\nIn a house that's not a home The pain in my heart 'cause we're a thousand miles apart\nI've got no one to blame for the shame\n'Cause she's waiting back home\nI hope she's waiting back home\nStupid to think that I could blame it on the drink\nNow I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home\nI hope there's someone back home Oh well, home ain't what I'm callin'\nBut I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways\nThe pain gets so much clearer\nWhen the one to blame is standing in the mirror\nThis fool, this life\nLit a match and set his life on fire\nI guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore\nMust have known all along that I was wrong\n'Cause there's no one at home\nNo one's waiting back home Well, home ain't what I'm callin'\nBut I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways\nThe pain gets so much clearer\nWhen the one to blame is standing in the mirror\nThis fool, this life\nLit a match and set his life on fire\nI guess I'd rather be alone\nIn a house that's not a home From underneath the trees, we watch the sky\nConfusing stars for satellites\nI never dreamed that you'd be mine\nBut here we are, we're here tonight Singing Amen, I'm alive (I'm alive)\nSinging Amen, I'm alive If everyone cared and nobody cried\nIf everyone loved and nobody lied\nIf everyone shared and swallowed their pride\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died\nAnd I'm singing Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive\nAmen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive And in the air the fireflies\nOur only light in paradise\nWe'll show the world they were wrong\nAnd teach them all to sing along Singing Amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)\nSinging Amen, I, I'm alive If everyone cared and nobody cried\nIf everyone loved and nobody lied\nIf everyone shared and swallowed their pride\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died\nIf everyone cared and nobody cried\nIf everyone loved and nobody lied\nIf everyone shared and swallowed their pride\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died And as we lie beneath the stars\nWe realize how small we are\nIf they could love like you and me\nImagine what the world could be If everyone cared and nobody cried\nIf everyone loved and nobody lied\nIf everyone shared and swallowed their pride\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died\nIf everyone cared and nobody cried\nIf everyone loved and nobody lied\nIf everyone shared and swallowed their pride\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day\nWhen nobody died\nThen we'd see the day, we'd see the day\nWhen nobody died\nThen we'd see the day when nobody died One step, two step, electric slide\nRed fish, blue fish, blow your mind\nEngine, engine, number nine\nMama gonna let you set the moon on fire Jack be nimble, jack be quick\nJack wound up with a broken neck\nHumpty Dumpty, do your thing\nDaddy gonna buy you a diamond ring Oh, it must be nice\nTo spend each day in paradise\nYou wonder why you've ever failed\nYour life's a goddamn fairy tale\nYour life's a goddamn fairy tale Suzie steamboat, you're so fine\nGrant the wish I wish tonight\nTinker tailor, whatcha' got?\nWheels on the bus are falling off Pretty maids all in a row\nYes, sir, yes, sir three bags full\nSilver spoon at supper time\nFour and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high Oh, it must be nice\nTo spend each day in paradise\nYou wonder why you've ever failed\nYour life's a goddamn fairy tale\nYour life's a goddamn fairy tale One step, two step, electric slide\nRed fish, blue fish, blow your mind\nEngine, engine, number nine\nStick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine Oh, it must be nice\nTo spend each day in paradise\nYou wonder why you've ever failed\nYour life's a goddamn fairy tale Oh, it must be nice\nTo spend each day in paradise\nYou wonder why you've ever failed\nYour life's a fucking fairy tale The first words that come out\nAnd I can see this song will be about you\nI can't believe that I can breathe without you\nBut all I need to do is carry on\nThe next line I write down\nAnd there's a tear that falls between the pages\nI know that pain's supposed to heal in stages\nBut it depends which one I'm standing on I write lines down, then rip them up\nDescribing love can't be this tough I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke\nI could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly\nTie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon\nPlay it for the world, but it won't mean much\nUnless I sing this song to you I'm dying to show you\nThis could end happily ever after\nThere doesn't ever have to be disaster\nAnd all you have to do is sing along I write lines down, then rip them up\nImpossible describing love I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke\nI could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly\nTie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon\nPlay it for the world, but it won't mean much\nUnless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire\nSing this song to you\nI could set this song on fire Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes\nDrown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost\nSing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune\nPlay it for the world, but it won't mean much I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke\nI could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly\nTie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon\nPlay it for the world, but it won't mean much\nUnless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire\nUnless I sing this song to you\nI could set this, I could set this\nI want to sing this song to you\nI could set this song on fire\nSing this song to you\nI could set this, I could set this You call to me, and I fall at your feet\nHow could anyone ask for more?\nAnd our time apart, like knives in my heart\nHow could anyone ask for more? But if there's a pill to help me forget,\nGod knows I haven't found it yet\nBut I'm dying to, God I'm trying to 'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far\nTrying not to need you, is tearing me apart\nCan't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor\nAnd I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for\n'Cause trying not to love you\nOnly makes me love you more\nOnly makes me love you more And this kind of pain, only time takes away\nThat's why it's harder to let you go\nAnd nothing I can do, without thinking of you\nThat's why it's harder to let you go\nBut if there's a pill to help me forget,\nGod knows I haven't found it yet\nBut I'm dying to, God I'm trying to It's trying not to love you, only goes so far\nTrying not to need you, is tearing me apart\nCan't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor\nAnd I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for\n'Cause trying not to love you\nOnly makes me love you more So I sit here divided, just talking to myself\nWas it something that I did?\nWas there somebody else?\nWhen a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears\nSat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear\nTonight I'm dying to tell you That trying not to love you, only went so far\nTrying not to need you, was tearing me apart\nNow I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for\nAnd if we just keep on trying, we could be much more\n'Cause trying not to love you\nOh, yeah, trying not to love you\nOnly makes me love you more\nOnly makes me love you more What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)\nWhat are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)\nAre you waiting on a lightening strike\nAre you waiting for the perfect night\nAre you waiting till the time is right?\nWhat are you waiting for wow\nDon't you wanna learn to deal with fear\nDon't you wanna take the wheel and steer\nDon't you wait another minute here\nWhat are you waiting for wow\nWhat are you waiting for wow oh You gotta go and reach for the top\nBelieve in every dream that you got\nYou only living one so tell me?\nWhat are you, what are you waiting for?\nYou know you gotta give it your all\nAnd don't you be afraid if you fall\nYou only living one so tell me?\nWhat are you, what are you waiting for?

lying, turn into hiding\nWith scars on both his lips, his fingertips\nWere melted to the bone But I can still remember what his face looked like\nWhen I found him in an alley in the middle of the night\nTell me what you know!

Tell me what you gone and done now!\nGun would do the trick, get it over with\nYou're better off\nTo take all you've got and burn it on the spot\nJust to get high, (high) Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating\nHe sold his mother's rings, she said nothing\nAnd pretended not to know\nHe started stealing, to supply the feeling\nFound out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife\nAnd held it to her throat But I can still remember what his face looked like\nWhen I found him in an alley in the middle of the night\nTell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!\nTell me what you know!

make your mark by mending a broken heart?\nYou know it's never too late to shoot for the stars\nRegardless of who you are\nSo do whatever it takes\nCause you can't rewind a moment in this life\nLet nothin' stand in your way\nCause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day\nAnd tomorrow was too late\nCould you say goodbye to yesterday?\nWould you live each moment like
