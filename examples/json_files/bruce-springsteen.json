[{"text": "[Verse 1]\nThey come from everywhere\nA longing to be free\nThey come to join us here\nFrom sea to shining sea And they all have a dream\nAs people always will\nTo be safe and warm\nIn that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door\nInstead of opening the gate\nAw, let's turn this thing around\nBefore it gets too late [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great [Verse 2]\nDon't tell me a lie\nAnd sell it as a fact\nI've been down that road before\nAnd I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me\nThat you never read a book\nI never put my faith\nIn a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path\nAnd tempt the hands of fate\nAw, let's turn this thing around\nBefore it gets too late [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great In the quiet of the night\nI lie here wide awake\nAnd I ask myself\nIs there a difference I can make? [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great I come from down in the valley\nWhere mister when you're young\nThey bring you up to do like your daddy done\nMe and Mary we met in high school\nWhen she was just seventeen\nWe'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green\nWe'd go down to the river\nAnd into the river we'd dive\nOh down to the river we'd ride Then I got Mary pregnant\nAnd man that was all she wrote\nAnd for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat\nWe went down to the courthouse\nAnd the judge put it all to rest\nNo wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle\nNo flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river\nAnd into the river we'd dive\nOh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company\nBut lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy\nNow all them things that seemed so important\nWell mister they vanished right into the air\nNow I just act like I don't remember\nMary acts like she don't care But I remember us riding in my brother's car\nHer body tan and wet down at the reservoir\nAt night on them banks I'd lie awake\nAnd pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take\nNow those memories come back to haunt me\nThey haunt me like a curse\nIs a dream a lie if it don't come true\nOr is it something worse\nThat sends me down to the river\nThough I know the river is dry\nThat sends me down to the river tonight\nDown to the river\nMy baby and I\nOh down to the river we ride The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves\nLike a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays\nRoy Orbison singing for the lonely\nHey, that's me and I want you only\nDon't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again\nDon't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for\nSo you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore\nShow a little faith, there's magic in the night\nYou ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright\nOh, and that's alright with me You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain\nMake crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain\nWaste your summer praying in vain\nFor a savior to rise from these streets\nWell now, I ain't no hero, that's understood\nAll the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood\nWith a chance to make it good somehow\nHey, what else can we do now?\nExcept roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair\nWell, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere\nWe got one last chance to make it real\nTo trade in these wings on some wheels\nClimb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand\nWe're riding out tonight to case the promised land\nOh oh oh oh, Thunder Road\nOh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road\nLying out there like a killer in the sun\nHey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run\nOh oh oh oh, Thunder Road\nSit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk\nAnd my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk\nFrom your front porch to my front seat\nThe door's open but the ride ain't free\nAnd I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken\nBut tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away\nThey haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets\nThey scream your name at night in the street\nYour graduation gown lies in rags at their feet\nAnd in the lonely cool before dawn\nYou hear their engines rolling on\nBut when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind\nSo Mary, climb in\nIt's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening\nAnd I ain't got nothing to say\nI come home in the morning\nI go to bed feeling the same way\nI ain't nothing but tired\nMan I'm just tired and bored with myself\nHey there baby, I could use just a little help You can't start a fire\nYou can't start a fire without a spark\nThis gun's for hire\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer\nRadio's on and I'm moving 'round the place\nI check my look in the mirror\nI want to change my clothes, my hair, my face\nMan I ain't getting nowhere\nI'm just living in a dump like this\nThere's something happening somewhere\nBaby I just know that there is You can't start a fire\nYou can't start a fire without a spark\nThis gun's for hire\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older\nThere's a joke here somewhere and it's on me\nI'll shake this world off my shoulders\nCome on baby this laugh's on me Stay on the streets of this town\nAnd they'll be carving you up alright\nThey say you gotta stay hungry\nHey baby I'm just about starving tonight\nI'm dying for some action\nI'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book\nI need a love reaction\nCome on now baby gimme just one look You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart\nThis gun's for hire\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\nYou can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart\nThis gun's for hire\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\nHey baby Well, it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again\nAnd it seems like I'll be wearing the same old chains\nGood will conquer evil and the truth will set me free\nAnd I know someday I will find the key\nAnd I know somewhere I will find the key Well, it seems like I've been playing your game way too long\nAnd it seems the game I've played has made you strong\nBut when the game is over I won't walk out the loser\nYeah I know that I'll walk out of here again\nYeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again But now, I'm trapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been sleeping in your bed too long\nAnd it seems like you've been meaning to do me harm\nBut I'll teach my eyes to see, beyond these walls in front of me\nAnd someday I'll walk out of here again\nYeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again But now, I'm trapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been playing your game way too long\nAnd it seems the game I've played has made you strong Because, I'm trapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah I'm trapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nTrapped, oh yeah\nI'm trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream\nAt night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines\nSprung from cages out on highway nine,\nChrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line\nH-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back\nIt's a death trap, it's a suicide rap\nWe gotta get out while we're young\n`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes, girl we were Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend\nI want to guard your dreams and visions\nJust wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims\nAnd strap your hands 'cross my engines\nTogether we could break this trap\nWe'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back\nH-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire\n`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider\nBut I gotta know how it feels\nI want to know if love is wild\nBabe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard\nGirls comb their hair in rearview mirrors\nAnd the boys try to look so hard\nThe amusement park rises bold and stark\nKids are huddled on the beach in a mist\nI wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight\nIn an everlasting kiss One, two, three, four! The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive\nEverybody's out on the run tonight\nBut there's no place left to hide\nTogether Wendy we can live with the sadness\nI'll love you with all the madness in my soul\nH-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when\nWe're gonna get to that place\nWhere we really wanna go\nAnd we'll walk in the sun\nBut till then tramps like us\nBaby we were born to run Oh honey, tramps like us\nBaby we were born to run Come on with me, tramps like us\nBaby we were born to run Men walking 'long the railroad tracks\nGoing someplace, there's no going back\nHighway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge\nHot soup on a campfire under the bridge\nShelter line stretching 'round the corner\nWelcome to the new world order\nFamilies sleeping in the cars in the southwest\nNo home, no job, no peace, no rest Well the highway is alive tonight\nBut nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes\nI'm sitting down here in the campfire light\nSearching for the ghost of Tom Joad He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag\nPreacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag\nWaiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last\nIn a cardboard box 'neath the underpass\nYou got a one-way ticket to the promised land\nYou got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand\nSleeping on a pillow of solid rock\nBathing in the city's aqueduct Go! Well the highway is alive tonight\nWhere it's headed everybody knows\nI'm sitting down here in the campfire light\nWaiting on the ghost of Tom Joad Now Tom said, \"Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy\nWherever a hungry newborn baby cries\nWhere there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air\nLook for me, Mom, I'll be there Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand\nOr a decent job or a helping hand\nWherever somebody's struggling to be free\nLook in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me\"\nYeah! The highway is alive tonight\nWhere it's headed everybody knows\nI'm sitting down here in the campfire light\nWith the ghost of old Tom Joad It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky\nMusta been a tear from your eye\nEverything'll be okay\nFunny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze\nMusta been you sighin' so deep\nDon't worry we're gonna find a way I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day\nGonna chase the clouds away\nI'm waitin' on a sunny day Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down\nI'm half a party in a one dog town\nI need you to chase the blues away\nWithout you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat\nAn ice cream truck on a deserted street\nI hope that you're coming to stay I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day\nGonna chase the clouds away\nWaitin' on a sunny day Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all\nSure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall\nSure as the turnin' of the night into day\nYour smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes\nLifts away the blues when I rise\nI hope that you're coming to stay I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day\nGonna chase the clouds away\nWaitin' on a sunny day Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat\nIn the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat\nWith a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round\nWith this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground\nSome all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands\nAnd some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand\nAnd now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand\nAnd some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light\nOh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded by the light\nShe got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East\nHe says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least\nAnd some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance\nAnd some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light\nOh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded by the light\nHe got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes\nShe said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break\nAnd Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside\nAnd little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride\nOh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier\nYes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here\nWell, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home\nHe said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own\nAnd now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune\nYes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon\nAnd some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night\nWell, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right He was just blinded by the light\nCut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\nBlinded by the light\nMama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun\nOh, but Mama, that's where the fun is\nOoh yeah\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded\nI was blinded Hey little girl is your daddy home\nDid he go away and leave you all alone,

like someone took a knife baby\nEdgy and dull and cut a six inch valley\nThrough the middle of my soul At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet\nAnd a freight train running through the middle of my head\nOnly you, can cool my desire\nOh, ho ho, I'm on fire\nOh, ho ho, I'm on fire\nOh, ho ho, I'm on fire Woo ooo ooo\nWoo ooo\nOoo ooo ooo\nWoo ooo ooo\nWoo ooo ooo I had a friend was a big baseball player\nBack in high school\nHe could throw that speed ball by you\nMake you look like a fool boy Saw him the other night at this roadside bar\nI was walking in, he was walking out\nWe went

that lives up the block\nBack in school she could turn all the boy's heads\nSometimes on a Friday I'll stop by\nAnd have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed Her and her husband Bobby, well they split up\nI guess it's two years gone by now\nWe just sit around talking about the old times,\nShe says when she feels like crying\nShe starts laughing thinking about Glory days well they'll pass you

battle in our dirty little war\nWhen I look at myself I don't see\nThe man I wanted to be\nSomewhere along the line I slipped off track\nI'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back There's a girl across the bar\nI get the message she's sendin'\nMmm she ain't lookin' to married\nAnd me well honey I'm pretending\nLast night I dreamed I held you in my arms\nThe music was never-ending\nWe danced as the evening sky faded to black\nOne step up and two steps back Last night I dreamed that I was a child\nOut where the pines grow wild and tall\nI was trying to make it home through the forest\nBefore the darkness falls I heard the wind rustling through the trees\nAnd ghostly voices rose from the fields\nI ran with my heart pounding down that broken path\nWith the devil snapping at my heels I broke through the trees and there in the night\nMy father's house stood shining hard and bright\nThe branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms\nBut I ran till I fell shaking in his arms I awoke and I imagined, the hard things that pulled us apart\nWill never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts\nI got dressed and to that house I did ride\nFrom out on the road I could see its windows shining in light I walked up the steps and stood on the porch\nA woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door\nI told her my story and who I'd come for\nShe said \"I'm sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore\" My father's house shines hard and bright\nIt stands like a beacon calling me in the night\nCalling and calling, so cold and alone\nShining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned Well you don't like, don't like the way I walk\nAnd you don't like, don't like the way I talk\nYou criticize about me endlessly\nLogic defies how you get stuck with me\nAnd you complain about the clothes I wear\nAnd you explain there's other boys out there\nYou complain my car makes too much noise\nAnd you cry I'm always out with the boys Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nI give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you You complain the way I love you at night\nYou explain I'm really not your type\nIf we go out, you say I'm such a bore\nIf we stay in, you say what are we living for\nI don't understand, there's nothing I can do\nThere ain't no way I can satisfy you\nEnd of the night I lean in for a kiss\nHere comes the pitch, a swing and a miss Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nI quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no matter what I do, well you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you, hey!\nHey!\n(Come on boys!) Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nHey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nNo matter what I do, girl you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you I tried to change, I got a job in sales\nI bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales\nAnd babe I tried to make the latest scene\nHitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine\nI bought a record with all the latest grooves\nA book of love with all the latest moves\nI bought some flowers and I waited at your door\nAnd you came out, didn't want to see me no more Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)\nI quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)\nYeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you\nHey! Hey! Hey!\nNo matter what I do, girl you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you\nAww no matter what I do, girl you know it's true\nAin't good enough for you\nWhoaaa!

Last night I dreamed the sky went black\nYou were drifting down and you couldn't get back\nYou were lost and in trouble so far from home\nI reached for you, my arms went to stone\nI woke and you were missing\nMissing... I searched for something to explain\nIn the whispering rain, the trembling leaves\nTell me baby where did you go\nYou were here just a moment ago There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall\nYour key in the door, your voice in the hall\nYour smell drifts through our bedroom\nI wake, but I don't move With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill\nWith her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me\nWith her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone\nBecause French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone\nWith her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun\nWhoa-oh, she's the one\nShe's the one That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark,\nit say's you're never gonna leave her\nBut there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies\nand all you want to do is believe her\nAnd tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through\nOh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,\nshe's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do\nAnd no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run\nWhoa-oh, she's the one\nShe's the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she's fill them long summer nights with her tenderness\nThat secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness\nOh, she's the one\nOh, she's the one\nOh, she's the one\nOh, she's the one\nOh, she's the one\nOh, she's the one In my dreams our love was lost.\nI lived by luck and faith.\nI carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late.\nNow i'm standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind.\nAnd honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.\nBack in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star.\nBut these promises we make at night, oh that's all they are.\nUnless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as a howlin' wind.\nAnd honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again..\nBack in your arms, back in your arms again.\nBack in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness.\nI met you with indifference, and I don't know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world.\nWhere all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls.\nAnd all the love I've thrown away and lost, I'm longing for again.\nNow darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.\nBack in your arms, back in your arms again.\nBack in your arms, back in your arms again.\nBack in your arms Every day

never lie Baby don't you know I don't care\nDon't you know that I've been there\nWell if something in the air feels a little unkind\nDon't worry darling, it'll slip your mind I know you think you'd

neighborhood drummer sound\nI can feel my heart begin to pound\nYou say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes\nAnd follow your dreams down Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\nLike soldiers in the winter's night\nWith a vow to defend\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender Well, now young faces grow sad and old\nAnd hearts of fire grow cold\nWe swore blood brothers against the wind\nNow I'm ready to grow young again\nAnd hear your sister's voice calling us home\nAcross the open yards\nWell maybe we'll cut someplace of our own\nWith these drums and these guitars 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\nBlood brothers in the stormy night\nWith a vow to defend\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim\nThe walls of my room are closing in\nThere's a war outside still raging\nYou say it ain't ours anymore to win\nI want to sleep beneath\nPeaceful skies in my lover's bed\nWith a wide open country in my eyes\nAnd these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\nBlood brothers in a stormy night\nWith a vow to defend\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh\nOhh ohh ohh\nOhh ohh ohh\nOhh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio\nBack in eighteen-o-three\nJames and Danny Heaton\nFound the ore that was linin' yellow creek\nThey built a blast furnace\nHere along the shore\nAnd they made the cannon balls\nThat helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown\nHere in Youngstown\nMy sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down\nHere darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces\nKept 'em hotter than hell\nI come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer\nA job that'd suit the devil as well\nTaconite, coke and limestone\nFed my children and made my pay\nThen smokestacks reachin' like the arms of god\nInto a beautiful sky of soot and clay Here in Youngstown\nHere in Youngstown\nMy sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down\nHere darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy come on the 0hio works\nWhen he come home from world war two\nNow the yards just scrap and rubble\nHe said, \"Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do\"\nThese mills they built the tanks and bombs\nThat won this country's wars\nWe sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam\nNow we're wondering what they were dyin' for Here in Youngstown\nHere in Youngstown\nMy sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down\nHere darlin' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley\nTo the Mesabi iron range\nTo the coal mines of Appalacchia\nThe story's always the same\nSeven-hundred tons of metal a day\nNow sir you tell me the world's changed\nOnce I made you rich enough\nRich enough to forget my name In Youngstown\nIn Youngstown\nMy sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down\nHere darlin' in Youngstown When I die I don't want no part of heaven\nI would not do heavens work well\nI pray the devil comes and takes me\nTo stand in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming\nIn Harlem late last night\nAnd the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine\nOver the Jersey state line\nBarefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge\nDrinking warm beer in the soft summer rain\nThe Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants\nTogether they take a stab at romance\nAnd disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo\nChasing the Rat and the barefoot girl\nAnd the kids 'round there live just like shadows\nAlways quiet, holding hands\nFrom the churches to the jails\nTonight all is silence in the world\nAs we take our stand\nDown in Jungleland The midnight gang's assembled\nAnd picked a rendezvous for the night\nThey'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign\nThat brings this fair city light\nMan, there's an opera out on the Turnpike\nThere's a ballet being fought out in the alley\nUntil the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night\nThe street's alive as secret debts are paid\nContacts made, they flash unseen\nKids flash guitars just like switchblades\nHustling for the record machine\nThe hungry and the hunted\nExplode into rock 'n' roll bands\nThat face off against each other out in the street\nDown in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage\nInside the backstreet girls are dancing\nTo the records that the DJ plays\nLonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners\nDesperate as the night moves on\nJust one look and a whisper, and they're gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat\nSoul engines running through a night so tender\nIn a bedroom locked in whispers\nOf soft refusal and then surrender\nIn the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down\nAs shots echo down them hallways in the night\nNo one watches when the ambulance pulls away\nOr as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz\nBetween what's flesh and what's fantasy\nAnd the poets down here don't write nothing at all\nThey just stand back and let it all be\nAnd in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment\nAnd try to make an honest stand\nBut they wind up wounded, not even dead\nTonight in Jungleland I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean\nWe'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline\nTo buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue\nBaby just one kiss will get these things for you\nA kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night\nProve it all night\nGirl there's nothing else that we can do\nSo prove it all night\nProve it all night\nAnd girl I'll prove it all night for you Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist\nThere's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this\nBut if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice\nBut this ain't no dream we're living through tonight\nGirl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night\nProve it all night\nProve it all night girl and call the bluff\nWe'll prove it all night\nProve it all night\nGirl I'll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow\nMeet me in the fields out behind the dynamo\nYou hear their voices telling you not to go\nThey've made their choices and they'll never know\nWhat it means to steal, to cheat, to lie\nWhat it's like to live and die Prove it all night\nProve it all night\nGirl there's nothing else that we can do\nSo prove it all night\nProve it all night\nAnd girl I'll prove it all night for you I'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night\nI'll prove it all night Spread out now Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins\nYou know playin' blind

he knows that I don't have any money\nOh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money\nWell, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance\nBecause a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy\nAnd my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey\nWell, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong\nBy the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms\nI know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way\nThere's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day\nYou can hear them in the back room strummin'\nSo hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'\nEverybody sing Rosalita, jump a little higher\nSenorita, come sit by my fire\nI just want to be your lover, ain't no liar\nRosalita, you're my stone desire Hey hey hey hey\nHey hey hey

a local bar\nHe bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark\nWell she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house\nShe checked herself out in the dining room mirror\nAnd undid an extra button on her blouse\nHe felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am\nHe was staring at the ceiling\nHe couldn't move his hands [Chorus]\nOh mama mama mama come quick\nI've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick\nThrow your arms around me in the cold dark night\nHey now mama don't shut out the light\nDon't you shut out the light\nDon't you shut out the

up the chrome\nHis mama said \"Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me\"\nHis pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory [Chorus] Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain\nBeyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name\nIn the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands\nHe stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been [Chorus] I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey, some misty years ago\nThrough the mud and the beer, and the blood and the cheers, I've seen champions come and go\nSo if you

room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall\nBut to get to Candy's room you gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall\nStrangers from the city, call my baby's number and they bring her toys\nWhen I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I want to be Candy's boy There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face\nA sadness all her own\nFrom which no man can keep Candy safe We kiss, my heart's pumpin' to my brain\nAnd the blood rushes in my veins, the fire rushes towards the skies\nI go driving, driving deep into the night\nI go driving deep into the light, in Candy's eyes She says, baby if you want to be wild\nYou got a lot to learn, close your eyes\nLet them melt, let them fire\nLet them burn\n'Cause in the darkness, there'll be hidden worlds that shine\nWhen I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings\nShe has men who give her anything she wants, but they don't see\nThat what she wants is me Oh, and I want her so\nI'll never let her go, no, no, no\nShe knows that I'd give\nAll that I got to give\nAll that I want, all that I live\nTo make Candy mine\nTonight She'll let you in her house\nIf you come knockin' late at night\nShe'll let you in her mouth\nIf the words you say are right If you pay the price\nShe'll let you deep inside\nBut there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car\nTo go drivin' round\nShe'll let you into the parts of herself\nThat'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart\nIf you got a hammer and a vise\nBut into her secret garden, don't think twice You've gone a million miles\nHow far'd you get\nTo that place where You can't remember\nAnd you can't forget She'll lead you down a path\nThere'll be tenderness in the air\nShe'll let you come just far enough\nSo you know she's really there\nShe'll look at you and smile\nAnd her eyes will say\nShe's got a secret garden\nWhere everything you want\nWhere everything you need\nWill always stay\nA million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face\nAnd you try so hard to see\nThe way things were when we were at your place\nEveryday was just you and me\nAnd you cry because things ain't like before\nWell, don't you know it can't be that way anymore\nBut don't worry baby\n'cause I can't talk now, I'm not alone\nSo put your ear close to the phone\n'cause this is the last dance, the last chance\nFor hearts of stone If there was something, baby,\nThat I could do,\nSomething that would last, honey, I would\nBut you should know better than to think that you\nCan return to the past\nSo close your eyes and I'll be there\nHold you once more and not go anywhere\nI wish I could babe\nBut I can't talk now, I'm not alone\nSo put your ear close to the phone\n'cause this is the last dance, the last chance\nFor hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast\nAnd you cry because nothing good ever lasts\nWell, I know babe\nBut I can't talk now, I'm not alone\nSo put your ear close to the phone\n'cause this is the last dance, the last chance\nFor hearts of stone\nI can't talk now, I'm not alone\nSo put your ear close to the phone\n'cause this is the last dance, the last chance\nFor hearts of stone I went out walking the other day\nSeen a little girl crying along the way\nShe'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again\nSome day your crying girl will end\nAnd you'll find once again Two hearts are better than one\nTwo hearts girl get the job done\nTwo hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes\nBut I was living in a world of childish dreams\nSomeday these childish dreams must end\nTo become a man and grow up to dream again\nI believe in the end Two hearts are better than one\nTwo hearts girl get the job done\nTwo hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned\nFor you to roam empty-hearted through this land\nThough the world turns you hard and cold\nThere's one thing mister, that I know\nThat's if you think your heart is stone\nAnd that you're rough enough to whip this world alone\nAlone buddy there ain't no peace of mind\nThat's why I'll keep searching 'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one\nTwo hearts girl get the job done\nTwo hearts are better than one Oh, two hearts are better than one\nTwo hearts girl get the job done\nTwo hearts are better than one Woah [Verse 1]\nThey come from everywhere\nA longing to be free\nThey come to join us here\nFrom sea to shining sea And they all have a dream\nAs people always will\nTo be safe and warm\nIn that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door\nInstead of opening the gate\nAw, let's turn this thing around\nBefore it gets too late [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great [Verse 2]\nDon't tell me a lie\nAnd sell it as a fact\nI've been down that road before\nAnd I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me\nThat you never read a book\nI never put my faith\nIn a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path\nAnd tempt the hands of fate\nAw, let's turn this thing around\nBefore it gets too late [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great In the quiet of the night\nI lie here wide awake\nAnd I ask myself\nIs there a difference I can make? [Chorus]\nIt's up to me and you\nLove can conquer hate\nI know this to be true\nThat's what makes us great "}]
