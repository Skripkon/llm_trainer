my own, well I guess this is growing up\nWell I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview\nYou'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy\nAnd I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay\nThe charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again\nYou'll turn to a friend\nSomeone that understands\nAnd sees through the master

guess this is growing up\nWell, I guess this is growing up\nWell, I guess this is growing up I never thought I'd die alone\nI laughed the loudest who'd have known?\nI trace the cord back to the wall\nNo wonder it was never plugged in at all\nI took my time, I hurried up\nThe choice was mine I didn't think enough\nI'm too depressed to go on\nYou'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came\nSixteen just held such better days\nDays when I still felt alive\nWe couldn't wait to get outside\nThe world was wide, too late to try\nThe tour was over, we'd survived\nI couldn't wait till I got home\nTo pass the time in my room alone I never thought I'd die alone\nAnother six months I'll be unknown\nGive all my things to all my friends\nYou'll never step foot in my room again\nYou'll close it off, board it up\nRemember the time that I spilled the cup\nOf apple juice in the hall\nPlease tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, when you came\nSixteen just held such better days\nDays when I still felt alive\nWe couldn't wait to get outside\nThe world was wide, too late to try\nThe tour was over, we'd survived\nI couldn't wait till I got home\nTo pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came\nTomorrow holds such better days\nDays when I can still feel alive\nWhen I can't wait to get outside\nThe world is wide, the time goes by\nThe tour is over, I've survived\nI can't wait till I get home\nTo pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait\nTo pick you up on our very first date\nIs it cool if I hold your hand?\nIs it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?\nDo you like my stupid hair?\nWould you guess that I didn't know what to wear?\nI'm just scared of what you think\nYou make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go\nDon't wait\nThis night's almost over\nHonest, let's make\nThis night last forever\nForever and ever\nLet's make this last forever\nForever and ever\nLet's make this last forever When you smile, I melt inside\nI'm not worthy for a minute of your time\nI really wish it was only me and you\nI'm jealous of everybody in the room\nPlease don't look at me with those eyes\nPlease don't hint that you're capable of lies\nI dread the thought of our very first kiss\nA target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go\nDon't wait\nThis night's almost over\nHonest, let's make\nThis night last

go motherfuckers)\nDo you want to come to a party\nMy friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30\nThis things at a frat house but the people are cool there\nReluctant I followed but I never dreamed there\nWould be someone there who would catch my attention\nI wasn't out searching for love or affection\nSo I paid my 3 and the girls got in free\nShine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band\nSomeone in the background was doing a keg stand\nThis place is so lame all these girls look the same\nAll these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed\nIn my bed back at home watching TV alone\nWhere I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone\nFar from people I hate down from anywhere state\nTrying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there\nWith green eyes and long blond hair\nShe wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that\nShe might be the one maybe we'd have some fun\nMaybe we'd watch the sun rise\nBut that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\nSome girls try too hard to impress\nWith the way that they dress\nWith those things on their chests\nAnd the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying\nThe names she was dropping the games she was playing\nShe dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's\nHow she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise\nNow I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this\nHer volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless\nSo I said I'd call her but never would bother\nUntil I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there\nWith green eyes and long blonde hair\nShe won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover\nThis girl's not the one and she'll never be fun\nYou should just turn and run because you'll find out that\nSome girls try too hard Some girls try too hard\nSome girls try too hard to impress\nWith the way that they dress\nWith those things on their chest\nAnd the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard\nSome girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again\nThe one where I wake up and I'm alive\nJust as the four walls close me within\nMy eyes are open up with pure sunlight\nI'm the first to know\nMy dearest friends\nEven if your hope has burned with time\nAnything that is dead shall be re-grown\nAnd your vicious pain, your warning sign\nYou will be fine hey yo here I am\nAnd here we go\nLife's waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown\nLike every single tree reach for the sky\nIf you're gonna to fall\nI'll let you know\nThat I will pick you up\nLike you for I\nI felt this thing\nI can't replace\nWhere everyone was working for this goal\nWhere all the children left without a trace\nOnly to come back as pure as gold\nTo recite this so\nhey yo here I am\nAnd here we go\nLife's waiting to begin\nTonight\nhey ohhh here I am\nAnd here we go\nLife's waiting to begin\nTonight\nhey yo here I am\nAnd here we go\nLife's waiting to begin I cannot live\nI can't breathe\nUnless you do this with me\nI cannot live\nI can't breathe\nUnless you do this with me\nI

I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately.\nI've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.\nI keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.\nI've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I'm sick of always hearing\nAll the sad songs on the radio\nAll day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy\nThat he's lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show\nWe would stay up all through the night\nWe would laugh and get high\nAnd never answer the phone I can't forgive\nCan't forget\nCan't give in what went wrong\n'Cause you said this was right\nYou fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing\nSappy love songs on the radio\nThis place is fucking cursed in its plague\nAnd I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can't forgive\nCan't forget\nCan't give in what went wrong\nCause you said this was right\nYou fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me\nWhat went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen\nDon't wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?\nWhere did I go wrong?\nSometimes I just don't know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving\nWe're not the same, we're two in a million\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days\nWe've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared\nYou're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing\nEveryone's done wrong\nSometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving\nWe're not the same, we're two in a million\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days\nWe've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days You're giving up\nWe're getting out\nWe were young and we're not growing up\nWe're not growing up You're giving up\nWe're getting out\nWe were young and we're not growing up\nWe're not growing up Save yourself where I was saving\nWe're not the same, we're two in a million\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days\nWe've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em\nWe stood as one, the young and forgotten\nThese are the good old days\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\nThese are the good old days These are the good old days\nThese are the good old days Last night it came as a picture\nWith a good reason, a warning sign\nThis place is void of all passion\nIf you can imagine it's easy if you try\nBelieve me I failed this effort\nI wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision\nThis time where are you Houston\nIs somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I\nI feel alone and tired\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nI hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories\nMost of them useless delusions\nThis room is bored of rehearsal\nAnd sick of the boundaries\nI miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I\nI feel alone and tired\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nThis time I don't want to\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nI feel alone and tired\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nI hope I won't forget you Should I go back should I go back should I\nI feel alone and tired\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nThis time I don't want to\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nI feel alone and tired\nShould I go back should I go back should I\nI hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go\nThey question who we used to be\nSometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between\nThe cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream\nOf going back to San Diego\nWe bought a one way ticket\nSo we could go see the Cure\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\nAnd think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)\nCan't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)\nLate at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)\nAbandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors\nI read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream\nOf going back to San Diego\nWe bought a one way ticket\nSo we could go see the Cure\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\nAnd think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)\nCan't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear\nAll of the pain and the fear\nYour secrets filled up my ears\nLike the ocean blue\nI never wanted to know\nHow deep these cuts on you go\nAnd like a river they flow\nTo the ocean blue Going back to San Diego\nWe bought a one way ticket\nSo we could go see the Cure\nAnd listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot\nAnd think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)\nCan't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now\n(I'm feeling this)\nThe air is so cold and numb\n(I'm feeling this)\nLet me go in her room\n(I'm feeling this)\nI wanna take off her clothes\n(I'm feeling this) Show me the way to bed\n(I'm feeling this)\nShow me the way you move\n(I'm feeling this)\nFuck it it's such a blur\n(I'm feeling this)\nI love all the things you do\n(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time\nYour smile fades in the summer\nPlace your hand in mine\nI'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here\nTurn all the lights down now\nSmiling from ear to ear\n(I'm feeling this)\nOur breathing has got too loud\n(I'm feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor\n(I'm feeling this)\nShow me the bathroom mirror\n(I'm feeling this)\nWere taking this way too slow\n(I'm feeling this)\nTake me away from here\n(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time\nYour smile fades in the summer\nPlace your hand in mine\nI'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time\nYour smile fades in the summer\nPlace your hand in mine\nI'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again after you came and went\nHow can you say you meant anything different\nTo anyone standing alone on the street\nWith a cigarette on the first night we met Look to the past and remember her smile\nAnd maybe tonight I can breathe for a while\nI'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep\nBut then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time\nYour smile fades in the summer\nPlace your hand in mine\nI'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time\n(Fate fell short this time)\nYour smile fades in the summer\n(Your smile fades in the summer)\nPlace your hand in mine\n(Place your hand in mine)\nI'll leave when I wanna\n(I'll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time\n(Fate fell short this time)\nYour smile fades in the summer\n(So lost and disillusioned)\nPlace your hand in mine\n(Place your hand in mine)\nI'll leave when I wanna\n(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time\n(Are we alone do you feel it)\nYour smile fades in the summer\n(So lost and disillusioned)\nPlace your hand in mine\n(Are we alone do you feel it)\nI'll leave when I wanna\n(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time\n(Are we alone do you feel it)\nYour smile fades in the summer\n(So lost and disillusioned)\nPlace your hand in mine\n(Are we alone do you feel it)\nI'll leave when I wanna\n(So lost and disillusioned) I know I messed up and it might be over\nBut let me call you when I'm sober\nI'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover\nBut let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa\nNa

dirt outside And she dragged me to the edge of town\nAnd she slapped me then she pulled me down\nI can do bad and you can do better\nSpending all night getting lost together I know I messed up and it might be over\nBut let me call you when I'm sober\nI'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover\nBut let me call you when I'm sober Sober\nSober I know I messed up and it might be over\nBut let me call

And if you're feeling scared\nRemember the time we shared\nYou know it meant everything (everything)\nYou know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago\nWe might have had it all\nBut I was so stupid then\nYou needed time to grow\nBut now just as things change\nAs well my feelings do\nIn time things rearrange\nI am so sick of chasing you But what do I get\n'Cause I just seem to lose\nYou make me regret\nThose times I spent with you\nAnd playing those games\nA I wait for your call\nAnd now I give up,\nSo goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace\nThis time I'll get it right\nIt's not a change of taste\nI was the one there last night You have your other friends\nThey were there\nWhen you cried\nDidn't mean to hurt you then\nBest friends just won't\nLeave your side But what do I get\n'Cause I just seem to lose\nYou make me regret\nThose times I spent with you\nAnd playing those games\nAs I wait for your call\nAnd now I give up,\nSo goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace\nThis time I'll get it right\nIt's not a change of taste\nI was the one there last night When I needed you most\nWhen I needed a friend\nYou let me down now\nLike I let you down then So sorry, it's over\n(Ah) One thing / I don't know why\nIt doesn't even matter how hard you try\nKeep that in mind / I designed this rhyme\nTo explain in due time\nAll I know\ntime is a valuable thing\nWatch it fly by as the pendulum swings\nWatch it count down to the end of the day\nThe clock ticks life away\nIt's so unreal\nDidn't look out below\nWatch the time go right out the window\nTrying to hold on / but didn't even know\nWasted it all just to\nWatch you go\nI kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart\nWhat it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried\nso hard\nAnd got so far\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter\nI had to fall\nTo lose it all\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter\nOne thing / I don't know why\nIt doesn't even matter how hard you try\nKeep that in mind / I designed this rhyme\nTo remind myself how\nI tried so hard\nIn spite of the way you were mocking me\nActing like I was part of your property\nRemembering all the times you fought with me\nI'm surprised it got so (far)\nThings aren't the way they were before\nYou wouldn't even recognize me anymore\nNot that you knew me back then\nBut it all comes back to me\nIn the end\nYou kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart\nWhat it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I\nI tried so hard\nAnd got so far\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter\nI had to fall\nTo lose it all\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter\nI've put my trust in you\nPushed as far as I can go\nFor all this\nThere's only one thing you should know\nI've put my trust in you\nPushed as far as I can go\nFor all this\nThere's only one thing you should know\nI tried so hard\nAnd got so far\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter\nI had to fall\nTo lose it all\nBut in the end\nIt doesn't even matter I saw you again\nI think you used me again\nShould we try this before we give up and move on\nAnd pretend to restore what we have and hold on\nAt times like these\nIt's obvious\nI saw you again\nI know you fucked him again\nCan you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge\nAre you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these\nIt's obvious\nAt times like these\nIt's obvious I saw you again and again and again\nThere's some room to move on, to move on, to move on\nAnd I saw you again and again and again\nHow do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again\nThere's some room to move on, to move on, to move on\nAnd I saw you again and again and again\nHow do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again\nThere's some room to move on, to move on, to move on\nAnd I saw you again and again and again\nHow do we fix this

Day in day out\nUp at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down\nDay in day out\nIt's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown\nWhoa\nListen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge\nWhoa\nListen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me\nLos Angeles when will you save me\nLos Angeles, when will you save me\nLos Angeles, I'm never coming home\n(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down\nI've been awake for days\nKnocked out\nBy the sound of falling rain\nCome down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky\nWatch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me\nLos Angeles, when will you save me\nLos Angeles, when will you save me\nLos Angeles, I'm never coming home Wake me when

save me\nLos Angeles when will you save me\nLos Angeles when will you save me\nLos Angeles I'm never coming home\nI'm never coming home\nI'm never coming home\nI'm never coming home\nI'm never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba]\nLate at night on mercy street\nThe summer air is way too sweet\nThe way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach\nSomething inside is incomplete\nI numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time\nI promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home)\nThe only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for\n(The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home)\nThe only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for\n(The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]\nThe tidal wave and aftermath\nI'm seasick from the years we've passed\nAdrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin\nShe said goodbye and left again\nThese empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time\nI promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home)\nThe only time I feel alive is when

Hoppus and Matt Skiba]\nLife's so strange\nTime won't change\nThe world slips by, I'm afraid that she never gave much anyway\nLife's so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)\n(I'll take the last train home)\nThe only time I feel
