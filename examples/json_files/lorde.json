smoother than a storm\nAnd the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold\nMy blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones\nIt keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me\nI move through town, I'm quiet like a fire\nAnd my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits\nSo people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes\nI'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends\nThey used to shout my name, now they whisper it\nI'm speeding up and this is the\nRed, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart\nWe rip the start, the colors disappear\nI never watch the stars there's so much down here\nSo I just try to keep up with them\nRed, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds\nAnd the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now\nPeople talk to me, and all their faces blur\nBut I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison\nAnd I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me\nI'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends\nThey used to shout my name, now they whisper it\nI'm speeding up and this is the\nRed, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart\nWe rip the start, the colors disappear\nI never watch the stars there's so much down here\nSo I just try to keep up with them\nRed, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat\nSparking up my heart\nAnd this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat Wait 'til you're announced\nWe've not yet lost all our graces\nThe hounds will stay in chains\nLook upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out\nSend the call out Call all the ladies out\nThey're in their finery\nA hundred jewels on throats\nA hundred jewels between teeth\nNow bring my boys in\nTheir skin in craters like the moon\nThe moon we love like a brother\nWhile he glows through the room Dancing around the lies we tell\nDancing around big eyes as well, ah\nEven the comatose\nThey don't dance and tell [Chorus]\nWe live in cities you'll never see on screen\nNot very pretty, but we sure know how to run things\nLiving in ruins of the palace within my dreams\nAnd you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air\nSo there So all the cups got broke\nShards beneath our feet\nBut it wasn't my fault\nAnd everyone's competing\nFor a love they won't receive\n'Cause what this palace wants is release [Chorus]\nWe live in cities you'll never see on screen\nNot very pretty, but we sure know how to run things\nLiving in ruins of the palace within my dreams\nAnd you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air\nSo there\nI'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care\nSo there [Chorus]\nWe live in cities you'll never see on screen\nNot very pretty, but we sure know how to run things\nLiving in ruins of the palace within my dreams\nAnd you know we're on each other's team We're on each other's team\nAnd you know we're on each other's team\nWe're on each other's team\nAnd you know and you know and you know (One, two) Baby really hurt me\nCrying in the taxi\nHe don't wanna know me\nSays he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm\nSays it was poison\nSo I guess I'll go home\nInto the arms of the girl that I love\nThe only love I haven't screwed up\nShe's so hard to please\nBut she's a forest fire\nI do my best to meet her demands\nPlay at romance, we slow dance\nIn the living room, but all that a stranger would see\nIs one girl swaying alone\nStroking her cheek They say, \"You're a little much for me\nYou're a liability\nYou're a little much for me\"\nSo they pull back, make other plans\nI understand, I'm a liability\nGet you wild, make you leave\nI'm a little much for\nE-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy\n'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore\nAnd then they are bored of me\nI know that it's exciting\nRunning through the night, but\nEvery perfect summer's\nEating me alive until you're gone\nBetter on my own They say, \"You're a little much for me\nYou're a liability\nYou're a little much for me\"\nSo they pull back, make other plans\nI understand, I'm a liability\nGet you wild, make you leave\nI'm a little much for\nE-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me\nDisappear into the sun\nYou're all gonna watch me\nDisappear into the sun Limelight\nLose my mind\nLimelight\nLose my mind\nLimelight\nLose my mind\nLimelight Oh god, I'm clean out of air in my lungs\nIt's all gone\nPlayed it so nonchalant\nIt's time we danced with the truth\nMove along with the truth\nOoh (hey)\nWe're sleeping through all the days\nI'm acting like I don't see every\nRibbon you used to tie yourself to me But my hips have missed your hips\nSo let's get to know the kicks\nWill you sway with me?\nGo astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend\nAin't a pill that could touch our rush\nBut what will we do when we're sober?\nWhen you dream with the fever\nBet you wish you could touch our rush\nBut what will we do when we're sober?\nThese are the games of the weekend\nWe pretend that we just don't care\nBut we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)\nWhen you dream with the fever\nBet you wish you could touch our rush\nBut what will we do when we're sober? Oh God, I'm closing my teeth\nAround this liquor, wet\nLimelight, lose my mind\nI know you're feeling it too\nCan we keep up with the ruse?\nAh ah (hey)\nB-bodies all through my house\nI know this story by heart\nJack and Jill got fucked up and possessive\nWhen they get dark But my hips have missed your hips\nSo let's get to know the kicks\nWill you sway with me?\nGo astray with me?

breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover\nLegs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into\nI forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to\nAnd Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short lived\nBecause no one can be bothered when it's humid like this\nAnd we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath\nThe ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder Now the days are getting cooler, and the burning of our limbs\nDoesn't happen quite as bad as the burn is just skin\nDeep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter\nLike the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter\nAnd everywhere we go I can feel the subtle taste\nOf the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed\nAnd you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning\nBut you come over at night and we practice all the breathing Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down I'll pull the trick if I want to\nI'll pull the trick and it comes true\nI'm chewing gum and it's killing you\nWe're getting dead and it's the right way to do it\nI see you happy in the front seat\nI see you with all of your front teeth\nYou're allergic but you never said\nWe're getting dead and it's the right way Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down Go all the way\nHave your fun, have it all\nSo take it down\nGet through the days\nDo your thing, do it well\nSo take it down There's nothing I want but money and time\nMillion dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick\nThere's nothing more cruel\nThan only nine lives\nA limit in spite\nWill do the trick trick trick trick We can leave the house lead the party let the people know\nGo drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go There's nothing as fun as coming untied\nAnd running with the kids in the park park park park\nThere's nothing that hurts like letting you go\nTiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark We can leave the house lead the party let the people know\nGo drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go\nIt's not about just being out with all our people\n'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw\nAnd now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know\nAnd now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know We were down in the hospital\nWaiting for you to get well\nIn the ambulance you're laughing\nThe real fun was when we were young\nLet's go back It feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound\nIt feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown\nIt feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down It feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down\nIt feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound\nIt feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown\nIt feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound\nIt feels better biting

biting down\nIt feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound\nIt feels better biting down [Verse 1:]\nI remember when your head caught flame\nIt kissed your scalp and caressed your brain\n(I remember when your head caught flame)\nWell you laughed, baby it's okay\nIt's buzzcut season anyway\n(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) [Chorus 1:]\nExplosions on TV\nAnd all the girls with heads inside a dream\nSo now we live beside the pool\nWhere everything is good [Verse 2:]\nWe ride the bus with the knees pulled in\nPeople should see how we're living\n(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)\nShut my eyes to the song that plays\nSometimes this has a hot, sweet taste\n(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) [Chorus 2:]\nThe men up on the news\nThey try to tell us all that we will lose\nBut it's so easy in this blue\nWhere everything is good [Post-Chorus:]\nAnd I'll never go home again\n(Place the call, feel it start)\nFavorite friend\n(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)\nI live in a hologram with you\nWhere all the things that we do for fun\n(And I'll breathe, and it goes)\nPlay along\n(Make believe, it's hyper-real)\nBut I live in a hologram with you [Bridge:]\nCola with the burnt-out taste\nI'm the one you tell your fears to\nThere'll never be enough of us [Chorus 1:]\nExplosions on TV\nAnd all the girls with heads inside a dream\nSo now we live beside the pool\nWhere everything is good [Post-Chorus]\nAnd I'll never go home again\n(Place the call, feel it start)\nFavorite friend\n(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)\nI live in a hologram with you\nWhere all the things that we do for fun\n(And I'll breathe, and it goes)\nPlay along\n(Make believe, it's hyper real)\nBut I live in a hologram with you It's time to let the lost boys take you in It's getting cold out\nYou let yourself down\nSo please don't go out\nYou're looking dead behind the eyes We'll stay at your house\nWatch all those late shows on TV...\nI like it best when you're in here with me And all the lost boys\nWe make a picture perfect team\nBruising sidewalks\nWith all the drumming of our feet\nAnd boy, I promise\nWe'll never ever let you leave\nNever let you
