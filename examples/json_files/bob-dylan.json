[{"text": "\n\t\t\t\u201cThere must be some way out of here,\u201d said the joker to the thief\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much confusion, I can\u2019t get no relief\nBusinessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth\nNone of them along the line know what any of it is worth\u201d\n\n\u201cNo reason to get excited,\u201d the thief, he kindly spoke\n\u201cThere are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke\nBut you and I, we\u2019ve been through that, and this is not our fate\nSo let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late\u201d\n\nAll along the watchtower, princes kept the view\nWhile all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too\n\nOutside in the distance a wildcat did growl\nTwo riders were approaching, the wind began to howl\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tOnce upon a time you dressed so fine\nYou threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn\u2019t you?\nPeople\u2019d call, say, \u201cBeware doll, you\u2019re bound to fall\u201d\nYou thought they were all kiddin\u2019 you\nYou used to laugh about\nEverybody that was hangin\u2019 out\nNow you don\u2019t talk so loud\nNow you don\u2019t seem so proud\nAbout having to be scrounging for your next meal\n\nHow does it feel\nHow does it feel\nTo be without a home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\n\nYou\u2019ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely\nBut you know you only used to get juiced in it\nAnd nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street\nAnd now you find out you\u2019re gonna have to get used to it\nYou said you\u2019d never compromise\nWith the mystery tramp, but now you realize\nHe\u2019s not selling any alibis\nAs you stare into the vacuum of his eyes\nAnd ask him do you want to make a deal?\n\nHow does it feel\nHow does it feel\nTo be on your own\nWith no direction home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\n\nYou never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns\nWhen they all come down and did tricks for you\nYou never understood that it ain\u2019t no good\nYou shouldn\u2019t let other people get your kicks for you\nYou used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat\nWho carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat\nAin\u2019t it hard when you discover that\nHe really wasn\u2019t where it\u2019s at\nAfter he took from you everything he could steal\n\nHow does it feel\nHow does it feel\nTo be on your own\nWith no direction home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\n\nPrincess on the steeple and all the pretty people\nThey\u2019re drinkin\u2019, thinkin\u2019 that they got it made\nExchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things\nBut you\u2019d better lift your diamond ring, you\u2019d better pawn it babe\nYou used to be so amused\nAt Napoleon in rags and the language that he used\nGo to him now, he calls you, you can\u2019t refuse\nWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to lose\nYou\u2019re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal\n\nHow does it feel\nHow does it feel\nTo be on your own\nWith no direction home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tOh God said to Abraham, \u201cKill me a son\u201d\nAbe says, \u201cMan, you must be puttin\u2019 me on\u201d\nGod say, \u201cNo.\u201d Abe say, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nGod say, \u201cYou can do what you want Abe, but\nThe next time you see me comin\u2019 you better run\u201d\nWell Abe says, \u201cWhere do you want this killin\u2019 done?\u201d\nGod says, \u201cOut on Highway 61\u201d\n\nWell Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose\nWelfare Department they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes\nHe asked poor Howard where can I go\nHoward said there\u2019s only one place I know\nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nOl\u2019 Howard just pointed with his gun\nAnd said that way down on Highway 61\n\nWell Mack the Finger said to Louie the King\nI got forty red, white and blue shoestrings\nAnd a thousand telephones that don\u2019t ring\nDo you know where I can get rid of these things\nAnd Louie the King said let me think for a minute son\nAnd he said yes I think it can be easily done\nJust take everything down to Highway 61\n\nNow the fifth daughter on the twelfth night\nTold the first father that things weren\u2019t right\nMy complexion she said is much too white\nHe said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you\u2019re right\nLet me tell the second mother this has been done\nBut the second mother was with the seventh son\nAnd they were both out on Highway 61\n\nNow the rovin\u2019 gambler he was very bored\nHe was tryin\u2019 to create a next world war\nHe found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor\nHe said I never engaged in this kind of thing before\nBut yes I think it can be very easily done\nWe\u2019ll just put some bleachers out in the sun\nAnd have it on Highway 61\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tEarly one mornin\u2019 the sun was shinin\u2019\nI was layin\u2019 in bed\nWond\u2019rin\u2019 if she\u2019d changed at all\nIf her hair was still red\nHer folks they said our lives together\nSure was gonna be rough\nThey never did like Mama\u2019s homemade dress\nPapa\u2019s bankbook wasn\u2019t big enough\nAnd I was standin\u2019 on the side of the road\nRain fallin\u2019 on my shoes\nHeading out for the East Coast\nLord knows I\u2019ve paid some dues gettin\u2019 through\nTangled up in blue\n\nShe was married when we first met\nSoon to be divorced\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\nBut I used a little too much force\nWe drove that car as far as we could\nAbandoned it out West\nSplit up on a dark sad night\nBoth agreeing it was best\nShe turned around to look at me\nAs I was walkin\u2019 away\nI heard her say over my shoulder\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet again someday on the avenue\u201d\nTangled up in blue\n\nI had a job in the great north woods\nWorking as a cook for a spell\nBut I never did like it all that much\nAnd one day the ax just fell\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\nWhere I happened to be employed\nWorkin\u2019 for a while on a fishin\u2019 boat\nRight outside of Delacroix\nBut all the while I was alone\nThe past was close behind\nI seen a lot of women\nBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\nTangled up in blue\n\nShe was workin\u2019 in a topless place\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\nI just kept lookin\u2019 at the side of her face\nIn the spotlight so clear\nAnd later on as the crowd thinned out\nI\u2019s just about to do the same\nShe was standing there in back of my chair\nSaid to me, \u201cDon\u2019t I know your name?\u201d\nI muttered somethin\u2019 underneath my breath\nShe studied the lines on my face\nI must admit I felt a little uneasy\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe\nTangled up in blue\n\nShe lit a burner on the stove\nAnd offered me a pipe\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d never say hello,\u201d she said\n\u201cYou look like the silent type\u201d\nThen she opened up a book of poems\nAnd handed it to me\nWritten by an Italian poet\nFrom the thirteenth century\nAnd every one of them words rang true\nAnd glowed like burnin\u2019 coal\nPourin\u2019 off of every page\nLike it was written in my soul from me to you\nTangled up in blue\n\nI lived with them on Montague Street\nIn a basement down the stairs\nThere was music in the caf\u00e9s at night\nAnd revolution in the air\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\nAnd something inside of him died\nShe had to sell everything she owned\nAnd froze up inside\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\nI became withdrawn\nThe only thing I knew how to do\nWas to keep on keepin\u2019 on like a bird that flew\nTangled up in blue\n\nSo now I\u2019m goin\u2019 back again\nI got to get to her somehow\nAll the people we used to know\nThey\u2019re an illusion to me now\nSome are mathematicians\nSome are carpenters\u2019 wives\nDon\u2019t know how it all got started\nI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doin\u2019 with their lives\nBut me, I\u2019m still on the road\nHeadin\u2019 for another joint\nWe always did feel the same\nWe just saw it from a different point of view\nTangled up in blue\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tHow many roads must a man walk

small\nCan be seen in the eyes of those that call\nTo make all that should be killed to crawl\nWhile others say don\u2019t hate nothing at all\nExcept hatred\n\nDisillusioned words like bullets bark\nAs human gods aim for their mark\nMake everything from toy guns that spark\nTo flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark\nIt\u2019s easy to see without looking too far\nThat not much is really sacred\n\nWhile preachers preach of evil fates\nTeachers teach that knowledge waits\nCan lead to hundred-dollar plates\nGoodness hides behind its gates\nBut even the president of the United

it\n\nAdvertising signs they con\nYou into thinking you\u2019re the one\nThat can do what\u2019s never been done\nThat can win what\u2019s never been won\nMeantime life outside goes on\nAll around you\n\nYou lose yourself, you reappear\nYou suddenly find you got nothing to fear\nAlone you stand with nobody near\nWhen a trembling distant voice, unclear\nStartles your sleeping ears to hear\nThat somebody thinks they really found you\n\nA question in your nerves is lit\nYet you know there is no answer fit\nTo satisfy, insure you not to quit\nTo keep it in your mind and not forget\nThat it is not he or she or them or it\nThat you belong to\n\nAlthough the masters make the rules\nFor the wise men and the fools\nI got nothing, Ma, to live up to\n\nFor them that must obey authority\nThat they do not respect in any degree\nWho despise their jobs, their destinies\nSpeak jealously of them that are free\nCultivate their flowers to be\nNothing more than something they invest in\n\nWhile some on principles baptized\nTo strict party platform ties\nSocial clubs in drag disguise\nOutsiders they can freely criticize\nTell nothing except who to idolize\nAnd then say God bless him\n\nWhile one who sings with his tongue on fire\nGargles in the rat race choir\nBent out of shape from society\u2019s pliers\nCares not to come up any higher\nBut rather get you down in the hole\nThat he\u2019s in\n\nBut I mean no harm nor put fault\nOn anyone that lives in a vault\nBut it\u2019s alright, Ma, if I can\u2019t please him\n\nOld lady judges watch people in pairs\nLimited in sex, they dare\nTo push fake morals, insult and stare\nWhile money doesn\u2019t talk, it swears\nObscenity, who really cares\nPropaganda, all is phony\n\nWhile them that defend what they cannot see\nWith a killer\u2019s pride, security\nIt blows the minds most bitterly\nFor them that think death\u2019s honesty\nWon\u2019t fall upon them naturally\nLife sometimes must get lonely\n\nMy eyes collide head-on with stuffed\nGraveyards, false gods, I scuff\nAt pettiness which plays so rough\nWalk upside-down inside handcuffs\nKick my legs to crash it off\nSay okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?\n\nAnd if my thought-dreams could be seen\nThey\u2019d probably put my head in a guillotine\nBut it\u2019s alright, Ma, it\u2019s life, and life only\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tI\u2019m walking through streets that are dead\nWalking, walking with you in my head\nMy feet are so tired, my brain is so wired\nAnd the clouds are weeping\n\nDid I hear someone tell a lie?\nDid I hear someone\u2019s distant cry?\nI spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile\nWhile I was sleeping\n\nI\u2019m sick of love but I\u2019m in the thick of it\nThis kind of love I\u2019m so sick of it\n\nI see, I see lovers in the meadow\nI see, I see silhouettes in the window\nI watch them \u2019til they\u2019re gone and they leave me hanging on\nTo a shadow\n\nI\u2019m sick of love; I hear the clock tick\nThis kind of love; I\u2019m love sick\n\nSometimes the silence can be like the thunder\nSometimes I feel like I\u2019m being plowed under\nCould you ever be true? I think of you\nAnd I wonder\n\nI\u2019m sick of love; I wish I\u2019d never met you\nI\u2019m sick of love; I\u2019m trying to forget you\n\nJust don\u2019t know what to do\nI\u2019d give anything to be with you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tOh, the ragman draws circles\nUp and down the block\nI\u2019d ask him what the matter was\nBut I know that he don\u2019t talk\nAnd the ladies treat me kindly\nAnd furnish me with tape\nBut deep inside my heart\nI know I can\u2019t escape\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nWell, Shakespeare, he\u2019s in the alley\nWith his pointed shoes and his bells\nSpeaking to some French girl\nWho says she knows me well\nAnd I would send a message\nTo find out if she\u2019s talked\nBut the post office has been stolen\nAnd the mailbox is locked\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nMona tried to tell me\nTo stay away from the train line\nShe said that all the railroad men\nJust drink up your blood like wine\nAn\u2019 I said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that\nBut then again, there\u2019s only one I\u2019ve met\nAn\u2019 he just smoked my eyelids\nAn\u2019 punched my cigarette\u201d\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nGrandpa died last week\nAnd now he\u2019s buried in the rocks\nBut everybody still talks about\nHow badly they were shocked\nBut me, I expected it to happen\nI knew he\u2019d lost control\nWhen he built a fire on Main Street\nAnd shot it full of holes\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nNow the senator came down here\nShowing ev\u2019ryone his gun\nHanding out free tickets\nTo the wedding of his son\nAn\u2019 me, I nearly got busted\nAn\u2019 wouldn\u2019t it be my luck\nTo get caught without a ticket\nAnd be discovered beneath a truck\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nNow the preacher looked so baffled\nWhen I asked him why he dressed\nWith twenty pounds of headlines\nStapled to his chest\nBut he cursed me when I proved it to him\nThen I whispered, \u201cNot even you can hide\nYou see, you\u2019re just like me\nI hope you\u2019re satisfied\u201d\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nNow the rainman gave me two cures\nThen he said, \u201cJump right in\u201d\nThe one was Texas medicine\nThe other was just railroad gin\nAn\u2019 like a fool I mixed them\nAn\u2019 it strangled up my mind\nAn\u2019 now people just get uglier\nAn\u2019 I have no sense of time\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nWhen Ruthie says come see her\nIn her honky-tonk lagoon\nWhere I can watch her waltz for free\n\u2019Neath her Panamanian moon\nAn\u2019 I say, \u201cAw come on now\nYou must know about my debutante\u201d\nAn\u2019 she says, \u201cYour debutante just knows what you need\nBut I know what you want\u201d\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo be stuck inside of Mobile\nWith the Memphis blues again\n\nNow the bricks lay on Grand Street\nWhere the neon madmen climb\nThey all fall there so perfectly\nIt all seems so well timed\nAn\u2019 here I sit so patiently\nWaiting to find out what price\nYou have to pay to get out of\nGoing through all these things twice\nOh, Mama, can this really be the end\nTo

fall\n\nOh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?\nOh, what did you see, my darling young one?\nI saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it\nI saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it\nI saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin\u2019\nI saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin\u2019\nI saw a white ladder all covered with water\nI saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken\nI saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children\nAnd it\u2019s a hard, and it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard\nAnd it\u2019s a hard rain\u2019s a-gonna fall\n\nAnd what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?\nAnd what did you hear, my darling young one?\nI heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin\u2019\nHeard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world\nHeard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin\u2019\nHeard ten thousand whisperin\u2019 and nobody listenin\u2019\nHeard one person starve, I heard many people laughin\u2019\nHeard the song of a poet who died in the gutter\nHeard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley\nAnd it\u2019s a hard, and it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard\nAnd it\u2019s a hard rain\u2019s a-gonna fall\n\nOh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?\nWho did you meet, my darling young one?\nI met a young child beside a dead pony\nI met a white man who walked a black dog\nI met a young woman whose body was burning\nI met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow\nI met one man who was wounded in love\nI met another man who was wounded with hatred\nAnd it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard\nIt\u2019s a hard rain\u2019s a-gonna fall\n\nOh, what\u2019ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?\nOh, what\u2019ll you do now, my darling young one?\nI\u2019m a-goin\u2019 back out \u2019fore the rain starts a-fallin\u2019\nI\u2019ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest\nWhere the people are many and their hands are all empty\nWhere the pellets of poison are flooding their waters\nWhere the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\nWhere the executioner\u2019s face is always well hidden\nWhere hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten\nWhere black is the color, where none is the number\nAnd I\u2019ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it\nAnd reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it\nThen I\u2019ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin\u2019\nBut I\u2019ll know my song well before I start singin\u2019\nAnd it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard\nIt\u2019s a hard rain\u2019s a-gonna fall\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tClose your eyes, close the door\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore\nI\u2019ll be your baby tonight\n\nShut the light, shut the shade\nYou don\u2019t have to be afraid\nI\u2019ll be your baby tonight\n\nWell, that mockingbird\u2019s gonna sail away\nWe\u2019re gonna forget it\nThat big, fat moon is gonna shine like a

long time to die\n\nI\u2019m waist deep, waist deep in the mist\nIt\u2019s almost like, almost like I don\u2019t exist\nI\u2019m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n\nThe walls of pride are high and wide\nCan\u2019t see over to the other side\nIt\u2019s such a sad thing to see beauty decay\nIt\u2019s sadder still to feel your heart torn away\n\nOne look at you and I\u2019m out of control\nLike the universe has swallowed me whole\nI\u2019m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n\nThere\u2019s too many people, too many to recall\nI thought some of \u2019m were friends of mine, I was wrong about \u2019m all\nWell, the road is rocky and the hillside\u2019s mud\nUp over my head nothing but clouds of blood\n\nI found my world, found my world in you\nBut your love just hasn\u2019t proved true\nI\u2019m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\nTwenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n\nOh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds\nReality has always had too many heads\nSome things last longer than you think they will\nThere are some kind of things you can never kill\n\nIt\u2019s you and you only I been thinking about\nBut you can\u2019t see in and it\u2019s hard lookin\u2019 out\nI\u2019m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n\nWell the fat\u2019s in the fire and the water\u2019s in the tank\nThe whiskey\u2019s in the jar and the money\u2019s in the bank\nI tried to love and protect you because I cared\nI\u2019m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared\n\nLooking at you and I\u2019m on my bended knee\nYou have no idea

to win and nothing to lose\nFrom fixtures and forces and friends\nYour sorrow does stem\nThat hype you and type you\nMaking you feel\nThat you must be exactly like them\n\nI\u2019d forever talk to you\nBut soon my words\nThey would turn into a meaningless ring\nFor deep in my heart\nI know there is no help I can bring\nEverything passes\nEverything changes\nJust do what you think you should do\nAnd someday maybe\nWho knows, baby\nI\u2019ll come and be cryin\u2019 to you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tMy love she speaks like silence\nWithout ideals or violence\nShe doesn\u2019t have to say

and bus stations\nPeople talk of situations\nRead books, repeat quotations\nDraw conclusions on the wall\nSome speak of the future\nMy love she speaks softly\nShe knows there\u2019s no success like failure\nAnd that failure\u2019s no success at all\n\nThe cloak and dagger dangles\nMadams light the candles\nIn ceremonies of the horsemen\nEven the pawn must hold a grudge\nStatues made of matchsticks\nCrumble into one another\nMy love winks, she does not bother\nShe knows too much to argue or to judge\n\nThe bridge at midnight trembles\nThe country doctor rambles\nBankers\u2019 nieces seek perfection\nExpecting all the gifts that wise men bring\nThe wind howls like a hammer\nThe night blows cold and rainy\nMy love she\u2019s like some raven\nAt my window with a broken

wrong in thinking\nThat you have forgotten me? \n\nNow they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret\nThey waste your nights and days\nThem I will forget\nBut you I'll remember always\nOld

live on rice and beans\nSome people never worked a day in their life\nDon't know what work even means \n\nMeet me at the bottom, don't lag behind\nBring me my boots and shoes\nYou can hang back or

to\nIn the end\nMy dear sweet friend\nI\u2019ll remember you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tSeen the arrow on the doorpost\nSaying, \u201cThis land is condemned\nAll the way from New Orleans\nTo Jerusalem\u201d\nI traveled through East Texas\nWhere many martyrs fell\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\nLike Blind Willie McTell\n\nWell, I heard that hoot owl singing\nAs they were taking down the tents\nThe stars above the barren trees\nWere his only audience\nThem charcoal gypsy maidens\nCan strut their feathers well\nBut nobody can sing the blues\nLike Blind Willie McTell\n\nSee them big plantations burning\nHear the cracking of the whips\nSmell that sweet magnolia blooming\nSee the ghosts of slavery ships\nI can hear them tribes a-moaning\nHear that undertaker\u2019s bell\nNobody can sing the blues\nLike Blind Willie McTell\n\nThere\u2019s a woman by the river\nWith some fine young handsome man\nHe\u2019s dressed up like a squire\nBootlegged whiskey in his hand\nThere\u2019s a chain gang on the highway\nI can hear them rebels yell\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\nLike Blind Willie McTell\n\nWell, God is in His heaven\nAnd we all want what\u2019s his\nBut power and greed and corruptible seed\nSeem to be all that there is\nI\u2019m gazing out the window\nOf the St. James Hotel\nAnd I know no one can sing the blues\nLike Blind Willie McTell\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tOf war and peace the truth just twists\nIts curfew gull just glides\nUpon four-legged forest clouds\nThe cowboy angel rides\nWith his candle lit into the sun\nThough its glow is waxed in black\nAll except when \u2019neath the trees of Eden\n\nThe lamppost stands with folded arms\nIts iron claws attached\nTo curbs \u2019neath holes where babies wail\nThough it shadows metal badge\nAll and all can only fall\nWith a crashing but meaningless blow\nNo sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden\n\nThe savage soldier sticks his head in sand\nAnd then complains\nUnto the shoeless hunter who\u2019s gone deaf\nBut still remains\nUpon the beach where hound dogs bay\nAt ships with tattooed sails\nHeading for the Gates of Eden\n\nWith a time-rusted compass blade\nAladdin and his lamp\nSits with Utopian hermit monks\nSidesaddle on the Golden Calf\nAnd on their promises of paradise\nYou will not hear a laugh\nAll except inside the Gates of Eden\n\nRelationships of ownership\nThey whisper in the wings\nTo those condemned to act accordingly\nAnd wait for succeeding kings\nAnd I try to harmonize with songs\nThe lonesome sparrow sings\nThere are no kings inside the Gates of Eden\n\nThe motorcycle black madonna\nTwo-wheeled gypsy queen\nAnd her silver-studded phantom cause\nThe gray flannel dwarf to scream\nAs he weeps to wicked birds of prey\nWho pick up on his bread crumb sins\nAnd there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden\n\nThe kingdoms of Experience\nIn the precious wind they rot\nWhile paupers change possessions\nEach one wishing for what the other has got\nAnd the princess and the prince\nDiscuss what\u2019s real and what is not\nIt doesn\u2019t matter inside the Gates of Eden\n\nThe foreign sun, it squints upon\nA bed that is never mine\nAs friends and other strangers\nFrom their fates try to resign\nLeaving men wholly, totally free\nTo do anything they wish to do but die\nAnd there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden\n\nAt dawn my lover comes to me\nAnd tells me of her dreams\nWith no attempts to shovel the glimpse\nInto the ditch of what each one means\nAt times I think there are no words\nBut these to tell what\u2019s true\nAnd there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tAin\u2019t it just like the night to play tricks when you\u2019re tryin' to be so quiet?\nWe sit here stranded, though we\u2019re all doin\u2019 our best to deny it\nAnd Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin\u2019 you to defy it\nLights flicker from the opposite loft\nIn this room the heat pipes just cough\nThe country music station plays soft\nBut there\u2019s nothing, really nothing to turn off\nJust Louise and her lover so entwined\nAnd these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind\n\nIn the empty lot where the ladies play blindman\u2019s bluff with the key chain\nAnd the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the \u201cD\u201d train\nWe can hear the night watchman click his flashlight\nAsk himself if it\u2019s him or them that\u2019s really insane\nLouise, she\u2019s all right, she\u2019s just near\nShe\u2019s delicate and seems like the mirror\nBut she just makes it all too concise and too clear\nThat Johanna\u2019s not here\nThe ghost of \u2019lectricity howls in the bones of her face\nWhere these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\n\nNow, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously\nHe brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously\nAnd when bringing her name up\nHe speaks of a farewell kiss to me\nHe\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all\nMuttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall\nHow can I explain?\nOh, it\u2019s so hard to get on\nAnd these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn\n\nInside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial\nVoices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\nBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\nYou can tell by the way she smiles\nSee the primitive wallflower freeze\nWhen the jelly-faced women all sneeze\nHear the one with the mustache say, \u201cJeeze\nI can\u2019t find my knees\u201d\nOh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule\nBut these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\n\nThe peddler now speaks to the countess who\u2019s pretending to care for him\nSayin\u2019, \u201cName me someone that\u2019s not a parasite and I\u2019ll go out and say a prayer for him\u201d\nBut like Louise always says\n\u201cYa can\u2019t look at much, can ya man?\u201d\nAs she, herself, prepares for him\nAnd Madonna, she still has not showed\nWe see this empty cage now corrode\nWhere her cape of the stage once had flowed\nThe fiddler, he now steps to the road\nHe writes ev\u2019rything\u2019s been returned which was owed\nOn the back of the fish truck that loads\nWhile my conscience explodes\nThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\nAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tThe guilty undertaker sighs\nThe lonesome organ grinder cries\nThe silver saxophones say I should refuse you\nThe cracked bells and washed-out horns\nBlow into my face with scorn\nBut it\u2019s not that way\nI wasn\u2019t born to lose you\n\nI want you, I want you\nI want you so bad\nHoney, I want you\n\nThe drunken politician leaps\nUpon the street where mothers weep\nAnd the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you\nAnd I wait for them to interrupt\nMe drinkin\u2019 from my broken cup\nAnd ask me to\nOpen up the gate for you\n\nI want you, I want you\nI want you so bad\nHoney, I want you\n\nHow all my fathers, they\u2019ve gone down\nTrue love they\u2019ve been without it\nBut all their daughters put me down\n\u2019Cause I don\u2019t think about it\n\nWell, I return to the Queen of Spades\nAnd talk with my chambermaid\nShe knows that I\u2019m not afraid to look at her\nShe is good to me\nAnd there\u2019s nothing she doesn\u2019t see\nShe knows where I\u2019d like to be\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter\n\nI want you, I want you\nI want you so bad\nHoney, I want you\n\nNow your dancing child with his Chinese suit\nHe spoke to me, I took his flute\nNo, I wasn\u2019t very cute to him, was I?\nBut I did it, though, because he lied\nBecause he took you for a ride\nAnd because time was on his side\nAnd because I . . .\n\nI want you, I want you\nI want you so bad\nHoney, I want you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tOur conversation was short and sweet\nIt nearly swept me off-a my feet\nAnd I\u2019m back in the rain, oh, oh\nAnd you are on dry land\nYou made it there somehow\nYou\u2019re a big girl now\n\nBird on the horizon, sittin\u2019 on a fence\nHe\u2019s singin\u2019 his song for me at his own expense\nAnd I\u2019m just like that bird, oh, oh\nSingin\u2019 just for you\nI hope that you can hear\nHear me singin\u2019 through these tears\n\nTime is a jet plane, it moves too fast\nOh, but what a shame if all we\u2019ve shared can\u2019t last\nI can change, I swear, oh, oh\nSee what you can do\nI can make it through\nYou can make it too\n\nLove is so simple, to quote a phrase\nYou\u2019ve known it all the time, I\u2019m learnin\u2019 it these days\nOh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\nIn somebody\u2019s room\nIt\u2019s a price I have to pay\nYou\u2019re a big girl all the way\n\nA change in the weather is known to be extreme\nBut what\u2019s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\nI\u2019m going out of my mind, oh, oh\nWith a pain that stops and starts\nLike a corkscrew to my heart\nEver since we\u2019ve been apart\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tHollis Brown\nHe lived on the outside of town\nHollis Brown\nHe lived on the outside of town\nWith his wife and five children\nAnd his cabin fallin\u2019 down\n\nYou looked for work and money\nAnd you walked a rugged mile\nYou looked for work and money\nAnd you walked a rugged mile\nYour children are so hungry\nThat they don\u2019t know how to smile\n\nYour baby\u2019s eyes look crazy\nThey\u2019re a-tuggin\u2019 at your sleeve\nYour baby\u2019s eyes look crazy\nThey\u2019re a-tuggin\u2019 at your sleeve\nYou walk the floor and wonder why\nWith every breath you breathe\n\nThe rats have got your flour\nBad blood it got your mare\nThe rats have got your flour\nBad blood it got your mare\nIf there\u2019s anyone that knows\nIs there anyone that cares?\n\nYou prayed to the Lord above\nOh please send you a friend\nYou prayed to the Lord above\nOh please send you a friend\nYour empty pockets tell yuh\nThat you ain\u2019t a-got no friend\n\nYour babies are crying louder\nIt\u2019s pounding on your brain\nYour babies are crying louder now\nIt\u2019s pounding on your brain\nYour wife\u2019s screams are stabbin\u2019 you\nLike the dirty drivin\u2019 rain\n\nYour grass it is turning black\nThere\u2019s no water in your well\nYour grass is turning black\nThere\u2019s no water in your well\nYou spent your last lone dollar\nOn seven shotgun shells\n\nWay out in the wilderness\nA cold coyote calls\nWay out in the wilderness\nA cold coyote calls\nYour eyes fix on the shotgun\nThat\u2019s hangin\u2019 on the wall\n\nYour brain is a-bleedin\u2019\nAnd your legs can\u2019t seem to stand\nYour brain is a-bleedin\u2019\nAnd your legs can\u2019t seem to stand\nYour eyes fix on the shotgun\nThat you\u2019re holdin\u2019 in your hand\n\nThere\u2019s seven breezes a-blowin\u2019\nAll around the cabin door\nThere\u2019s seven breezes a-blowin\u2019\nAll around the cabin door\nSeven shots ring out\nLike the ocean\u2019s pounding roar\n\nThere\u2019s seven people dead\nOn a South Dakota farm\nThere\u2019s seven people dead\nOn a South Dakota farm\nSomewhere in the distance\nThere\u2019s seven new people born\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tBeen so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed\nLook how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams\nIn another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed\nTo some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams\n\nI and I\nIn creation where one\u2019s nature neither honors nor forgives\nI and I\nOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives\n\nThink I\u2019ll go out and go for a walk\nNot much happenin\u2019 here, nothin\u2019 ever does\nBesides, if she wakes up now, she\u2019ll just want me to talk\nI got nothin\u2019 to say, \u2019specially about whatever was\n\nI and I\nIn creation where one\u2019s nature neither honors nor forgives\nI and I\nOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives\n\nTook an untrodden path once, where the swift don\u2019t win the race\nIt goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth\nTook a stranger to teach me, to look into justice\u2019s beautiful face\nAnd to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\n\nI and I\nIn creation where one\u2019s nature neither honors nor forgives\nI and I\nOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives\n\nOutside of two men on a train platform there\u2019s nobody in sight\nThey\u2019re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track\nThe world could come to an end tonight, but that\u2019s all right\nShe should still be there sleepin\u2019 when I get back\n\nI and I\nIn creation where one\u2019s nature neither honors nor forgives\nI and I\nOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives\n\nNoontime, and I\u2019m still pushin\u2019 myself along the road, the darkest part\nInto the narrow lanes, I can\u2019t stumble or stay put\nSomeone else is speakin\u2019 with my mouth, but I\u2019m listening only to my heart\nI\u2019ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot\n\nI and I\nIn creation where one\u2019s nature neither honors nor forgives\nI and I\nOne says to the other, no man sees my face and lives\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tPerhaps it\u2019s the color of the sun cut flat\nAn\u2019 cov\u2019rin\u2019 the crossroads I\u2019m standing at\nOr maybe it\u2019s the weather or something like that\nBut mama, you been on my mind\n\nI don\u2019t mean trouble, please don\u2019t put me down or get upset\nI am not pleadin\u2019 or sayin\u2019, \u201cI can\u2019t forget\u201d\nI do not walk the floor bowed down an\u2019 bent, but yet\nMama, you been on my mind\n\nEven though my mind is hazy an\u2019 my thoughts they might be narrow\nWhere you been don\u2019t bother me nor bring me down in sorrow\nIt don\u2019t even matter to me where you\u2019re wakin\u2019 up tomorrow\nBut mama, you\u2019re just on my mind\n\nI am not askin\u2019 you to say words like \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\nPlease understand me, I got no place for you t\u2019 go\nI\u2019m just breathin\u2019 to myself, pretendin\u2019 not that I don\u2019t know\nMama, you been on my mind\n\nWhen you wake up in the mornin\u2019, baby, look inside your mirror\nYou know I won\u2019t be next to you, you know I won\u2019t be near\nI\u2019d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear\nAs someone who has had you on his mind\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tWhen the rain is blowing in your face\nAnd the whole world is on your case\nI could offer you a warm embrace\nTo make you feel my love\n\nWhen the evening shadows and the stars appear\nAnd there is no one there to dry your tears\nI could hold you for a million years\nTo make you feel my love\n\nI know you haven\u2019t made your mind up yet\nBut I would never do you wrong\nI\u2019ve known it from the moment that we met\nNo doubt in my mind where you belong\n\nI\u2019d go hungry, I\u2019d go black and blue\nI\u2019d go crawling down the avenue\nThere\u2019s nothing that I wouldn\u2019t do\nTo make you feel my love\n\nThe storms are raging on the rollin\u2019 sea\nAnd on the highway of regret\nThe winds of change are blowing wild and free\nYou ain\u2019t seen nothing like me yet\n\nI could make you happy, make your dreams come true\nNothing that I wouldn\u2019t do\nGo to the ends of the earth for you\nTo make you feel my love\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tWell, my nerves are exploding and my body\u2019s tense\nI feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence\nI\u2019ve been hit too hard, I\u2019ve seen too much\nNothing can heal me now, but your touch\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\nI was all right \u2019til I fell in love with you\n\nWell, my house is on fire, burning to the sky\nI thought it would rain but the clouds passed by\nNow I feel like I\u2019m coming to the end of my way\nBut I know God is my shield and he won\u2019t lead me astray\nStill I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\nI was all right \u2019til I fell in love with you\n\nBoys in the street beginning to play\nGirls like birds flying away\nWhen I\u2019m gone you will remember my name\nI\u2019m gonna win my way to wealth and fame\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\nI was all right \u2019til I fell in love with you\n\nJunk is piling up, taking up space\nMy eyes feel like they\u2019re falling off my face\nSweat falling down, I\u2019m staring at the floor\nI\u2019m thinking about that girl who won\u2019t be back no more\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\nI was all right \u2019til I fell in love with you\n\nWell, I\u2019m tired of talking, I\u2019m tired of trying to explain\nMy attempts to please you were all in vain\nTomorrow night before the sun goes down\nIf I\u2019m still among the living, I\u2019ll be Dixie bound\nI just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\nI was all right \u2019til I fell in love with you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tGod knows you ain\u2019t pretty\nGod knows it\u2019s true\nGod knows there ain\u2019t anybody\nEver gonna take the place of you\n\nGod knows it\u2019s a struggle\nGod knows it\u2019s a crime\nGod knows there\u2019s gonna be no more water\nBut fire next time\n\nGod don\u2019t call it treason\nGod don\u2019t call it wrong\nIt was supposed to last a season\nBut it\u2019s been so strong for so long\n\nGod knows it\u2019s fragile\nGod knows everything\nGod knows it could snap apart right now\nJust like putting scissors to a string\n\nGod knows it\u2019s terrifying\nGod sees it all unfold\nThere\u2019s a million reasons for you to be crying\nYou been so bold and so cold\n\nGod knows that when you see it\nGod knows you\u2019ve got to weep\nGod knows the secrets of your heart\nHe\u2019ll tell them to you when you\u2019re asleep\n\nGod knows there\u2019s a river\nGod knows how to make it flow\nGod knows you ain\u2019t gonna be taking\nNothing with you when you go\n\nGod knows there\u2019s a purpose\nGod knows there\u2019s a chance\nGod knows you can rise above the darkest hour\nOf any circumstance\n\nGod knows there\u2019s a heaven\nGod knows it\u2019s out of sight\nGod knows we can get all the way from here to there\nEven if we\u2019ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tI can\u2019t wait, wait for you to change your mind\nIt\u2019s late, I\u2019m trying to walk the line\nWell, it\u2019s way past midnight and there are people all around\nSome on their way up, some on their way down\nThe air burns and I\u2019m trying to think straight\nAnd I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait\n\nI\u2019m your man, I\u2019m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew\nYou understand that my heart can\u2019t go on beating without you\nWell, your loveliness has wounded me, I\u2019m reeling from the blow\nI wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so\nI\u2019m breathing hard, standing at the gate\nBut I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait\n\nSkies are grey, I\u2019m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow\nNight or day, it doesn\u2019t matter where I go anymore, I just go\nIf I ever saw you coming I don\u2019t know what I would do\nI\u2019d like to think I could control myself, but it isn\u2019t true\nThat\u2019s how it is when things disintegrate\nAnd I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait\n\nI\u2019m doomed to love you, I\u2019ve been rolling through stormy weather\nI\u2019m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together\n\nIt\u2019s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun\nOh, honey, after all these years you\u2019re still the one\nWhile I\u2019m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind\nI left my life with you somewhere back there along the line\nI thought somehow that I would be spared this fate\nBut I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tIn the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need\nWhen the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed\nThere\u2019s a dyin\u2019 voice within me reaching out somewhere\nToiling in the danger and in the morals of despair\n\nDon\u2019t have the inclination to look back on any mistake\nLike Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break\nIn the fury of the moment I can see the Master\u2019s hand\nIn every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand\n\nOh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear\nLike criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer\nThe sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way\nTo ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay\n\nI gaze into the doorway of temptation\u2019s angry flame\nAnd every time I pass that way I always hear my name\nThen onward in my journey I come to understand\nThat every hair is numbered like every grain of sand\n\nI have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night\nIn the violence of a summer\u2019s dream, in the chill of a wintry light\nIn the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space\nIn the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face\n\nI hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea\nSometimes I turn, there\u2019s someone there, other times it\u2019s only me\nI am hanging in the balance of the reality of man\nLike every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tWell, your railroad gate, you know I just can\u2019t jump it\nSometimes it gets so hard, you see\nI\u2019m just sitting here beating on my trumpet\nWith all these promises you left for me\nBut where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\n\nWell, I waited for you when I was half sick\nYes, I waited for you when you hated me\nWell, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic\nWhen you knew I had some other place to be\nNow, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\n\nWell, anybody can be just like me, obviously\nBut then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately\n\nWell, six white horses that you did promise\nWere fin\u2019lly delivered down to the penitentiary\nBut to live outside the law, you must be honest\nI know you always say that you agree\nBut where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know how it happened\nBut the riverboat captain, he knows my fate\nBut ev\u2019rybody else, even yourself\nThey\u2019re just gonna have to wait\n\nWell, I got the fever down in my pockets\nThe Persian drunkard, he follows me\nYes, I can take him to your house but I can\u2019t unlock it\nYou see,

strike\nHis closest friends were black men \u2019cause they seemed to understand\nWhat it\u2019s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand\n\nWhen they let him out in \u201971 he\u2019d lost a little weight\nBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great\nHe tried to find the way back into the life he left behind\nTo the boss he said, \u201cI have returned and now I want what\u2019s mine\u201d\n\nJoey, Joey\nKing of the streets, child of clay\nJoey, Joey\nWhy did they have to come and blow you away?\n\nIt was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun\n\u201cI\u2019m around too many children,\u201d he\u2019d say, \u201cthey should never know of one\u201d\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe\nEmptied out the register, said, \u201cTell \u2019em it was Crazy Joe\u201d\n\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York\nHe could see it comin\u2019 through the door as he lifted up his fork\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy\n\nJoey, Joey\nKing of the streets, child of clay\nJoey, Joey\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\n\nSister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep\nI heard his best friend Frankie say, \u201cHe ain\u2019t dead, he\u2019s just asleep\u201d\nThen I saw the old man\u2019s limousine head back towards the grave\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save\n\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born\nAnd someday if God\u2019s in heaven overlookin\u2019 His preserve\nI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve\n\nJoey, Joey\nKing of the streets, child of clay\nJoey, Joey\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\tWe carried you in our arms\nOn Independence Day\nAnd now you\u2019d throw us all

instruction\nWhich we never could believe\nAnd now the heart is filled with gold\nAs if it was a purse\nBut, oh, what kind of love is this\nWhich goes from bad to worse?\nTears of rage, tears of grief\nMust I always be the thief?\nCome to me now, you know\nWe\u2019re so low\nAnd life is brief\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\tCan\u2019t you hear that rooster crowin\u2019?\nRabbit runnin\u2019 down
