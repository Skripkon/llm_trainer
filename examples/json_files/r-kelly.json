I need you, I need you, I need you to come back home, ohhhh, please I Believe lyrics By R. KELLY\nBARACK OBAMA:\nIn small towns and big cities\nWe came together\nAs democrats, republicans, and independents\nTo stand up and say that we are\nONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE\nAnd our time for changed has COME.. R. KELLY:\nWhen the mountain seems too high\nAnd you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb\nAnd the road you're on won't end\nBut still you run though you cannot see the finish line And dark clouds are over you\nYour skies no longer blue\nBut you marched on straight ahead\nSomehow you made it through Got to the mountain peek\nThey left a path of me\nYour victory made history and now CHORUS:\nI believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh I When it felt like you were weak\nAnd couldn't fight no more\nOn the ropes and it seemed like\nYou was gonna run out of breathe When the world was on your shoulder\nAnd the walls were in your way\nYou leaped and made it over\nThrough it all you kept the faith With hope you set us free\nYou showed us how to dream\nAnd now we can lift our voices\nAnd forever sing Now the time to look ahead\nAnd thank our heroes of the past\nAnd celebrate this victory\nLet's raise the flag cause CHORUS:\nI believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh I BRIDGE:\nAnd when they tried to keep you down\nYou kept up your head\nNever losing sight\nYou believed in what was right You endured to the end\nWalked through the strongest wind\nThe storms over\nAnd a new day begins And when our hope was dying\nYou brought us healing\nAnd now I got something\nTo tell my children CHORUS:\nI believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh, I believe, I believe, I believe\nOh I Baby you are the song of my life\nAnd the sweetest melody\nAnd I love making love to your eyes\nIt's like singing in the perfect key You are my number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nYou are my number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit I got

number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit The way you put your music on me\nSymphony should be your name\nIt's like God gave me the perfect echo\nWhen he sent your love my way You are my number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit\nMy number one hit New York to L.A. then press on to Rome\nL.A. then Vegas then press our way home\nOur music plays all around the world\nAnd my life has been a smash since you became My number one hit As I lay me down\nHeaven hear me now\nI'm lost without a cause\nAfter giving it my all Winter storms have come\nAnd darkened my sun\nAfter all that I've been through\nWho on earth can I turn to I look to you\nI look to you After all my strength is gone\nIn you I can be strong I look to you\nI look to you Yeah And when melodies are gone\nIn you I hear a song I look to you, you About to lose my breathe,\nThere's no more fighting left,\nI'm sinking to rise no more,\nSearching for that open door, door Every road that I've taken\nLead to my regret.\nI don't know if I'm going to make it.\nNothing to do but lift my head I look to you.\nI look to you.\nAfter all my strength is gone,\nIn you I can be strong\nI look to you.\nI look to you.\nAnd when melodies are gone,\nIn you I hear a song.\nI look to you (Whitney)\nWe love you

what i'm gonna do\nI don't think i'm gonna last then\nI begain to flash back on the things\nI done in my past\nThen I heard a small voice that said\nI'll give you peace if you believe\nI accepted Christ that day\nHalilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store\nWith a pain in my chest and I'm wondering\nWhere did it come from (I got tested)\nAnd the results

since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with\nProblem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do\nSee, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place\nLook in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face\nAnd then my tears roll down and hit the sink\nThen I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry\nAll these questions deep inside my mind\nLike if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama\nI'm still tryin' to get the answer why\nYou were young, 45, and you had to die\nI'm always tryin' to help people out\nAnd it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth (Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make\n(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create\n(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive\n(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'\nNeed to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'\nI'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off\nFools ride up in my camp and be actin' off\nSomebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout\nStill young tryin' to figure it out Heaven, I need a hug\nIs there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug\nFeelin' like a change of heart\nAnd all I really need is a sign or a word from God\nSo shower down on me, wet me with your love\nI need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah I gave 13 years of my life to this industry\nHit song or not, I've given all of me\nYou smile in my face and tell me that you love\nBut then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me\nThat's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'\n'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'\nAnd reach for the sky, focus on the plan\nRescue the kid with his paper a pen\nAnd this is for the homies that we lost\nYo', we

love\nTo my sister and to brothers\nTell me why can't we just try to get along with one another\nAnd stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another\nMan, I pray to God He get my family back together\nLet me see what want to see, just to blind me\nAll of these luxuries, wine and dining\nAnd then You push me out in front to get behind me\nThen You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me\nI'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high\nGotta go to church now to avoid the fight\nFrankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired\nHave dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive (Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'\n(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged\n(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men\n(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above,
