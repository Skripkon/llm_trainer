why\nI wish I could be the perfect daughter\nBut I come back to the water\nNo matter how hard I try Every turn I take\nEvery trail I track\nEvery path I make\nEvery road leads back to the place I know\nWhere I cannot go\nWhere I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea\nIt calls me\nNo one knows how far it goes\nIf the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me\nOne day I'll know\nIf I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island\nSeems so happy on this island\nEverything is by design\nI know everybody on this island\nHas a role on this island\nSo maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride\nI can make us strong\nI'll be satisfied if I play along\nBut the voice inside sings a different song\nWhat is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea\nIt's blinding\nBut no one knows how deep it goes\nAnd it seems like it's calling out to me\nSo come find me\nAnd let me know\nWhat's beyond that line\nWill I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea\nIt calls me\nAnd no one knows how far it goes\nIf the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me\nOne day I'll know\nHow far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam\nI was a drab little crab once\nNow I know I can be happy as a clam\nBecause I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?\nBe who you are on the inside?\nI need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny\nLike a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck\nScrub the deck and make it look shiny\nI will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck\nJust a sec, don't ya know\nFish are dumb, dumb, dumb\nThey chase anything that glitters, beginners\nOh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters\nMmm fish dinners\nI

hide\nI can't I'm too shiny\nWatch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough\nStrut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny\nSend your armies but they'll never be enough\nMy shell's too tough, Maui man\nYou can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod\nLook it up\nYou will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you\nChasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted\nYou tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough\nMaui, now it's time to kick your heiney\nEver seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see\nC'est la vie, mon ami\nI'm so shiny\nNow I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me\nYou'll never be quite as shiny\nYou wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is\nYou can't step in the same river twice\nThe water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that\nWe all must pay a price\nTo be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend\nWaiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend\nBeyond the shore where the gulls fly free\nDon't know what for what I dream the day might send\nJust around the river bend for me, coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees\nOr right behind these waterfalls\nCan I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls\nAnd never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend\nJust around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend\nBeyond the shore somewhere past the sea\nDon't know what for why do all my dreams extend\nJust around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course\nSteady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?\nIs all my dreaming at an end?\nOr do you still wait for me, dream giver\nJust around the river bend?

And still my heart is singing\nWe were right We were right\nAnd if I never knew you\nI'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why\nLost forever I know you\nI walked with you\nOnce Upon a dream\nI know you That gleam in your eyes\nIs so familiar a gleam\nYet I know it's true\nThat visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you\nI know what you do\nYou'll love me at once\nThe way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah\nBut if I know you\nI know what you do\nYou'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream\nI know you\nI walked with

at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me\nWhen the road looks rough ahead\nAnd you're miles and miles\nFrom your nice warm bed\nJust remember what your old pal said\nBoy, you've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got troubles, well I've got 'em too\nThere isn't anything I wouldn't do for you\nWe stick together and we see it through\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me Some other folks might be\nA little bit smarter than I am\nBigger and stronger too\nMaybe\nBut none of them will ever love you the way I do\nIt's me and you\nAnd as the years go by\nBoys, our friendship will never die\nYou're gonna see\nIt's our destiny\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me\nYou've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place\nWhere a hero's welcome would be waiting for me\nWhere the crowds would cheer, when they see my face\nAnd a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday, I can go the distance\nI will find my way if I can be strong\nI know every mile would be worth my while\nWhen I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate\nThough that road may wander, it will lead me to you\nAnd a thousand years would be worth the wait\nIt might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back, I can go the distance\nAnd I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat\nIt's an uphill slope\nBut I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance\nAnd my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part\nFor a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance\nI will search the world, I will face its harms\nI don't care how far, I can go the distance\n'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms\n'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings\nTo hold me down\nTo make me fret\nOr make me frown\nI had strings\nBut now I'm free\nThere are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o\nThat's the only way to go\nI want the world to know\nNothing ever worries me I've got no strings\nSo I have fun\nI'm not tied up to anyone\nThey've got strings\nBut you can see\nThere are no strings on me You have no strings\nYour arms is free\nTo love me by the Zuider Zee\nYa, ya, ya\nIf you would woo\nI'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings\nComme ci comme ca\nYour savoire-faire is ooh la la\nI've got strings\nBut entre nous\nI'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows\nThere's a Russian rendezvous\nWhere me and Ivan go\nBut I'd rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying\nIt will be alright\nJust take my hand\nAnd hold it tight I will protect you\nFrom all around you\nI will be here\nDon't you cry For one so small,\nYou seem so strong\nMy arms will hold you,\nKeep you safe and warm\nThis bond between us\nCan't be broken\nI will be here\nDon't you cry 'Cause you'll be in my heart\nYes, you'll be in my heart\nFrom this day on\nNow and forever more\nYou'll be in my heart\nNo matter what they say\nYou'll be here in my heart\nAlways Why can't they understand the way we feel\nThey just don't trust what they can't explain\nI know we're different, but deep inside us\nWe're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart\nYes you'll be in my heart\nFrom this day on\nNow and forever more Don't listen to them\n'Cause what do they know\nWe need each other, to have, to hold\nThey'll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong\nI may not be with you\nBut you got to hold on\nThey'll see in time, I know\nWe'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart\nBelieve me you'll be in my heart\nI'll be there from this day on\nNow and forever more You'll be in my heart\nNo matter what they say\nYou'll be here in my heart\nAlways Always I'll be with you\nI'll be there for you always\nAlways and always Just look over your shoulder\nJust look over your shoulder\nJust look over your shoulder\nI'll be there\nAlways "}]
