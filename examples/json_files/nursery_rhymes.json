burnt his mouth\n    With eating cold pease porridge.\n\n\n\n\nSIMPLE SIMON\n\n\n    Simple Simon met a pie-man,\n      Going to the fair;\n    Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,\n      \"Let me taste your ware.\"\n\n    Says the pie-man unto Simon,\n      \"First give me a penny.\"\n    Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,\n      \"I have not got any.\"\n\n    He went to catch a dicky-bird,\n      And thought he could not fail,\n    Because he had got a little salt\n      To put upon his tail.\n\n    He went to ride a spotted cow,\n      That had got a little calf,\n    She threw him down upon the ground,\n      Which made the people laugh.\n\n    Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,\n      For to catch a hare,\n    He rode a goat about the street,\n      But could not find one there.\n\n    He went for to eat honey\n      Out of the mustard-pot,\n    He bit his tongue until he cried,\n      That was all the good he got.\n\n    Simple Simon went a-fishing\n      For to catch a whale;\n    And all the water he had got\n      Was in his mother's pail.\n\n    He went to take a bird's nest,\n      Was built upon a bough;\n    A branch gave way, and Simon fell\n      Into a dirty slough.\n\n    He went to shoot a wild duck,\n      But the wild duck flew away;\n    Says Simon, \"I can't hit him,\n      Because he will not stay.\"\n\n    Once Simon made a great Snowball,\n      And brought it in to roast;\n    He laid it down before the fire,\n      And soon the ball was lost.\n\n    He went to slide upon the ice,\n      Before the ice would bear;\n    Then he plunged in above his knees,\n      Which made poor Simon stare.\n\n    He went to try if cherries ripe\n      Grew upon a thistle;\n    He pricked his finger very much,\n      Which made poor Simon whistle.\n\n    He washed himself with blacking-ball,\n      Because he had no soap:\n    Then, then, said to his mother,\n      \"I'm a beauty now, I hope.\"\n\n    He went for water in a sieve,\n      But soon it all ran through;\n    And now poor Simple Simon\n      Bids you all adieu.\n\n\n\n\nTOAD AND FROG\n\n\n    \"Croak,\" said the toad, \"I'm hungry I think,\n    To-day I've had nothing to eat or to drink;\n    I'll crawl to a garden and jump through the pales,\n    And there I'll dine nicely on slugs and on snails.\"\n\n    \"Ho, ho!\" quoth the frog, \"is that what you mean?\n    Then I'll hop away to the next meadow stream,\n    There I will drink, and eat worms and slugs too,\n    And then I shall have a good dinner like you.\"\n\n\n\n\nLITTLE JACK HORNER\n\n\n      Little Jack Horner\n      Sat in a corner\n    Eating of Christmas pie;\n\n      He put in his thumb,\n      And pulled out a plum,\n    And cried \"What a good boy was I!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOOING\n\n\n        There was a little man,\n        Who wooed a little maid;\n    And he said: \"Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?\n        I have little more to say,\n        So will you ay or nay\n    For the least said is soonest mend-ed, ded, ded.\"\n\n        Then the little maid replied:\n        \"Should I be your little bride,\n    Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?\n        Will the flame that you're so rich in\n        Light a fire in the kitchen?\n    Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?\"\n\n\n\n\nHANDY PANDY\n\n\n    Handy Pandy, Jack-a-Dandy,\n      Loves plum-cake and

cat too many;\n    So they fought and they fit,\n    And they scratched and they bit,\n    Till, excepting their nails\n    And the tips of their tails,\n    Instead of two cats, there weren't any.\n\n\n\n\nBLOW WIND BLOW\n\n\n    Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!\n      That the miller may grind his corn;\n    That the baker may take it, and into rolls make it,\n      And send us some

Gave him a little work,\n      He did it very well.\n\n    I bade him go upstairs\n      To bring me a gold pin;\n    In coal-scuttle fell he,\n      Up to his little chin.\n\n    He went to the garden\n      To pick a little sage;\n    He tumbled on his nose,\n      And fell into a rage.\n\n    He went to the cellar\n      To draw a little beer;\n    And quickly did return\n      To say there was none there.\n\n\n\n\nCOCK-A-DOODLE-DO\n\n\n    Cock-a-doodle-do!\n    My dame has lost her shoe;\n    My master's lost his fiddle-stick,\n    And don't know what to do.\n\n

little kittens had nowhere to go;\n    So they laid them down on the mat at the door,\n    While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.\n\n    Then they crept in, as quiet as mice,\n    All wet with the snow, and as cold as ice,\n    For they found it was better, that stormy night,\n    To lie down and sleep than to quarrel and fight.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FLY AND THE HUMBLE-BEE\n\n\n
