bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\nWhichever comes first, for better or worse\nHe's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas\nHis gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt\nAnd fuck the whole universe I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (to take a stand)\nEverybody (everybody)\nCome take my hand come (come take my hand)\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\nJust letting you know that, you're not alone\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap\nI shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap\nYou said you was king\nYou lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings\nInstead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans\nI'll never let you down again, I'm back\nI promise to never go back on that promise\nIn fact, let's be honest, that last \"Relapse\" CD was eh\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\nRelax, I ain't goin' back to that now\nAll I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around\nIt's a game called circle and I don't know how\nI'm way too up to back down\nBut I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out\nThought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black

ground\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly, I probably did it subliminally\nFor you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through\nAnd don't realize what you did, believe me you\nI been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead\nNo more bee flingers, no more drama from now on\nI promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it\nYou couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel\nI'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub\nAnd lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not

ground\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly, I probably did it subliminally\nFor you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through\nAnd don't realize what you did, believe me you\nI been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead\nNo more bee flingers, no more drama from now on\nI promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it\nYou couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel\nI'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub\nAnd lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not I'm not afraid (I'm not

letting you know that, you're not alone\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright, because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright, because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is\nI can only tell you what it feels like\nAnd right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe\nI can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight\nAs long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight\nHigh off of love drunk from my hate\nIt's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer\nI suffocate and right before I'm about to drown\nShe resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,\nAnd I love it, wait\nWhere you going, I'm leaving you\nNo you ain't, come back\nWe're running right back, here we go again\nIt's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great\nI'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane\nBut when it's bad, it's awful\nI feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude\nI don't even know his name, I laid hands on her\nI'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright, because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright, because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much\nYou can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet\nAnd neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em\nNow you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em\nYou swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,\nNow you're in each others face,\nSpewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em\nYou push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,\nThrow 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em\nIt's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both\nSo they say it's best, to go your separate ways,\nGuess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday\nYesterday is over, it's a different day\nSound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her\nNext time you'll show restraint\nYou don't get another chance,\nLife is no Nintendo game, but you lied again\nNow you get to watch her leave,\nOut the window, guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright, because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright, because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things\nThat we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns\nSame routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is\nYou're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded\nBaby please come back, it wasn't you,\nBaby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\nMaybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much, to walk away now\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,\nTold you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball\nNext time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall\nNext time, there will be no next time\nI apologize even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fucking leave again\nI'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright, because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright, because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie [Bruno Mars]\nThis one's for you and me, living out our dreams\nWe're all right where we should be\nWith my arms out wide I open my eyes\nAnd now all I wanna see\nIs a sky full of lighters\nA

I wear tens\nLet's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see\nWhat it'd be like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what I'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's mind\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you so\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh\nThey can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world\nWhere they can be alone\nAre you calling me, are you trying to get through\nAre you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon\nAnd to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes\nThat fit you, so put em on and wear 'em\nAnd be yourself man, be proud of who you are\nEven if it sounds corny,\nDon't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful Yeah\nI know sometimes things may not\nAlways make sense to you right now\nBut hey,\nWhat daddy always tell you?\nStraighten up little soldier\nStiffen up that upper lip\nWhat you crying about?\nYou got me Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad\nWell I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\nCause you're scared, I ain't there?\nDaddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\nDaddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLaney uncles crazy, ain't he?\nYeah but he loves you girl and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world\nWhen it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls\nTwo little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze\nI know it's confusing you\nDaddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up his daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have gotten so bad between us\nI don't see us ever being together ever again\nLike we used to be when we were teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny\nI remember back one year when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\nAnd stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me\nCause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\nCause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in\nEither kept getting broken into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\nAnd flew you and momma out to see me\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Laney were to young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\nCause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLaney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah\nIt's got a ring to it don't it?\nShh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdies neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha) Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess Have you ever loved someone so much\nYou'd give an arm for\nNot the expression, no\nLiterally give an arm for\nWhen they know they're your heart\nAnd you know you are their armor\nAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her\nBut what happens when karma\nTurns right around and bites you\nAnd everything you stand for turns on you to spite you\nWhat happens when you become the main source of her pain\n\"Daddy look what I made\"\n\"Dad's gotta go catch a plane\"\n\"Daddy where's mommy?\nI can't find mommy, where is she?\"\n\"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy\nDaddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself\"\nI give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself\nThen turn right around in that song and tell her you love her\nAnd put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her\nThat's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy\nShady made me\nBut tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream,\nI'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing\n\"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'\"\n\"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'\nYou always say that, you always say this is the last time\nBut you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine\"\nShe's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it\n\"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it\"\nGoes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\nIt's got a picture, \"This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya\"\nI look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror\nThese fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em\nThey're sayin', \"you got one more chance to do right\nAnd it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late\"\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\nIt turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat\nThe curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet\nI take a bow, and thank you all for comin out\nThey're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\nI glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'\n\"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'\"\nBut baby we're in Sweden\nHow did you get to Sweden?\n\"I followed you daddy\nYou told me that you weren't leavin'\nYou lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad\nAnd I bought you this coin, it says number one dad\nThat's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\"\n\"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'\"\n\"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice\nNow go out there and show em that you love em more than us\nThat's what they want\nThey want you, Marshall\nThey keep screamin' your name\nIt's no wonder you can't go to sleep\nJust take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!\nYou rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real\"\nI hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see\nHow could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me\nI turn around, find a gun on the ground\nCock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes\nThe plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up\nAlarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'\nIt's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'\nI walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her\nHailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life I told the world one day I would pay it back\nSay it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back\nBut I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that\nDoubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black\nHope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision\nWhen I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is\nAnd I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this\nAll I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest\nYou picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you\nBut for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do\nBut it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark\nLet me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you\nI don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue\nCause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick\nYou gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic\nOr you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause I'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas\nYou say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy\nBut you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more\nSeems like your own opinions, not one you can form\nCan't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself\nSecond guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help\nLike I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor\nI can endure no more I demand you remember who you are\nIt was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'\nYou don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth\nYou risked your career for me, I know it as well as you\nNobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth\nYou saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours\nBut I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more\nBut I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me\nGet up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake I'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life\nbring me back to life, bring me back to life,\nI need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) It literally feels like a lifetime ago\nBut I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though\nYou walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes\nOnce you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke\nWent through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left\nThey said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?\nNow that I need them, I don't see none of them\nAll I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him\nFuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us\nNow you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots\nYou gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?\nYou can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots\nAnd the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat\nMakin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards\nOne more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'\nI'll guarantee they scream, \"Dre, don't leave us like that man!\" cause I'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life May I have your attention please?\nMay I have your attention please?\nWill the real Slim Shady please stand up?\nI repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?\nWe're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before\nJaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door\nStarted whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced\nThrowing her over furniture\nIt's the return of the \"Oh wait, no way, your kidding,\nHe didn't just say what I think he did, did he?\"\nAnd Dr Dre said\nNothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)\nFeminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him\nLook at him, walking around grabbing his you know what\nFlippin' the you know who \"yeah, but he's so cute though\"\nYea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose\nBut no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms\nSometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,\nBut it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose\nMy bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\nAnd if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the message that we deliver to little kids\nAnd expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.\nOf course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,\nThey got the discovery channel don't they?\nWe ain't nothing but mammals,\nWell some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope\nBut if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.\nWomen wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo

'n' roll stations\nAnd I just do not got the patience\nTo deal with these cocky Caucasians\nWho think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black\n'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls\nSo they always keep asking the same fucking questions\nWhat school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what\nWhen and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out\nYou've been driving me crazy\nI can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit\nAnd I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit\nIn the bathroom without someone standing by it\nNo I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the papers, the news, everyday I

these kids that don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine\nWho post pinup pictures on their walls all day long\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\n'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die\n'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe\nWe're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes\nThat's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it\nSqueeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone\nJust let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs\nAnd we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years\n(Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears

Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you\nAll I ever felt was this\nHelplessness\nImprisoned by a selfish bitch\nChew me up and spit me out\nI fell for this so many times\nIts ridiculous\nAnd still I stick with this\nI'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction\nYour as addictive as they get\nEvil as they come vindictive as they make 'em\nMy friends keep asking why I cant just walk away\nI'm addicted\nTo the pain, the stress, the drama\nI'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess\nCursed and blessed\nBut this time I'm a\nAin't changing my mind\nI'm climbing out this abyss\nYou screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed\nBut when you spoke to people who meant the most to you\nYou left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop\nI'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch\nAnd its just Too late for the other side\nCaught in a chase\nTwenty five to life\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase\nTwenty five to life Too late\nCaught in a change\nTwenty five to life Feels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is\nFind different ways to word the same, old song\nEver since I came along\nFrom the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped\nStarted thinking my name was fault\n'Cause anytime things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg\nGangsta? Naw, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I've been against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\nDo I really belong in this game? I pondered\nI just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\nAnd keep pluggin', it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?\nBet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to\nMake a single sound\nAfraid I will never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I never before\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toe love\nRun out of excuses with every word\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear, (The time is here)\nGuts over fear, (I shall not tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nAnd let you keep me down\n(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents\nHate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on\nThat I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a fuck\"\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in the trailer park?\nAnd the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in\nAnd I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun\nSo to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song\nBut I'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than making another mothafuckin' \"We Made You\" uh\nNow I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just opened enough eyes later on\nGave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong\nAnd enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust having to balance my damn self\nBut on eggshells I was made to walk\nBut thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium\nAt least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song\nEverything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk\nTake it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off\nThe legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was gone I was afraid to\nMake a single sound\nAfraid I will never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I never before\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toe love\nRun out of excuses with every word\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear, (The time is here)\nGuts over fear, (I shall not tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nAnd let you keep me down\n(Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop\nIt's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit\nI'm on top bitch and rock for tricks\nHella whips and nips and flip trips for whips I get all the money, pussy falls like rain\nBeen gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain\nIf I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P\nIt's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye\nFuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size\nI got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo\nYou do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program\nFuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn\nTwisted Brown gets down with no assistance\nWe won't quit until we're banned from existence Persistence pays if that holds true\nThen I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through\nI was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'\nSo I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin' I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit\nYou act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit\nBut I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul\nBeen shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal So fuck off\nShit With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit\nBowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash\nI be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack\n'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack I be the do wa diddy up and down you block\nAnd the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'\nThe K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker\nAnd you still don't know me So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer\nI rock for the cash and the topless dancers\nDon't have no answers so pass the joint\nI'm just paid in full and made in Detroit I ride like Senna in the Indy 5\nAnd get live with that which gets me high\nStrive for perfection, this much is true\nWe do what we say, you say what we do Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo\nAnd I get to much P to ever be no homo\nRock from Soho to Arizona\nI'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna I roam the country like a Greyhound bus\nPut faith in lust, it ain't God I trust\nI'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies\nBut I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries And Harry Carey couldn't call my game\nFucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame\nAnd I show no shame from coast to coast\nI don't mean to brag, but I like to boast Fuck off Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch\nWith that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script\nNothing new since '76, Kid Rock\nYo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air\nThis planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair\nTwo white boys who spike punch and light joints\nHang around drugs, loud music and like noise Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers\nWho hate the world as much as each other\nAnd I ain't leaving this party tonight\nTill I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy\n'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me\n'Cause all I do is curse and fuck\nSo when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up\nSo when you see me on your block you better lock your cars\n'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars\nThis is for children who break rules, people

Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about, his name was, it was you\nDamn! Mom\nI know I let you down\nAnd though you say the days are happy\nWhy is the power off, and I'm fucked up?\nAnd mom, I know he's not around\nBut don't you place the blame on me\nAs you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night, I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far I went in headfirst\nNever thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse\nMy mom probably got it the worst\nThe brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are\nDid I take it too far?\nCleaning out my closet and all them other songs\nBut regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!\nYou're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom\nThough far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam\nDesert Storm and both of us put together\nCan form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare\nAnd forever we can drag this on and on\nBut, agree to disagree\nThat gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me\nYou're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)\nMa, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats\nWhy we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both\nWe're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)\nFurther away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings\nStill got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road\nAnd I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load\nThen Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and\nThat's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable\nAnd to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though\n'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth\nBut I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry\nRightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause\nNow I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes\nThat song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio\nAnd I think of Nathan being placed in a home\nAnd all the medicine you fed us\nAnd how I just wanted you to taste your own, but\nNow the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow\nAnd I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though\nBut ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo\nAll you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both\nFoster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours\nBut I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause\nOne thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was\nFuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address\nBut I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus\nOwn a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas\nSomeone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's\nIf I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them\nAnd although one has met their grandma\nOnce you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers\nMe, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you\nAnd as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me\nAs we pulled off to go our separate paths, and\nI saw your headlights as I looked back\nAnd I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad\nSo Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet\nI guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead\nThe stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing\nSo if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar\n'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far I want a new life\nOne without a cause\nSo I'm coming home tonight\nWell no matter what the cost\nAnd if the plane goes down\nOr if the crew can't wake me up\nJust know that I was alright\nAnd I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing\nMy children will carry me\nJust know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nBecause I put my faith in my new girl\nSo I never say goodbye cruel world\nJust know that I'm alright\nI am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi!

why\nWe can only get brighter\nThe further you put it behind ya\nBut right now I'm on the inside\nLookin out, cause I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process\nRebuilding and you're still a work in progress\nToday is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass\nThe thunderstorm has passed ya\nYour weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you\nUsed to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed\nSo focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner fast, the more asserted\nNever looking back, may hit the curb\nBut everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life\nSometimes you might not wanna swerve\nBut you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage\nCause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like\nIt happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive which means you must survive\nAlthough today you may weep because you're weak and\nEverything seems so bleak and hopeless\nThe light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in\nThat's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in\nAnd I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healin'\nAnd by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing\nTo forgive them even after all that shit you been put through\nThis feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning\nQuick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in\nBut you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down\nCause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin' As time passes, things change everyday\nBut wounds, wounds heal\nBut scars still remaining the same\nBut tomorrow today's goin' down in flames\nThrow the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet\nAs you barely even perspire from the heat\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\nIt's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\nBut you've extinguished this living hell\nStill a little piece of you dies, you scream I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn\nRising, a phoenix from the flames\nWith wings I will fly I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light I'm standing in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSetting fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key\nHated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's\nNo wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis\nMad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries\nGot a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall\nFull of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies\nDid y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please\nYou better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees\nWho you think brought you the oldies\nEazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's\nThe Snoop D-O-double-G's\nAnd the group that said motherfuck the police\nGave you a tape full of dope beats\nTo bump when

Chronic II\nStarting today and tomorrow's anew\nAnd I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew\nSlim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies\nIn a Mercedes Benz with the

fall down,\nStep by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down like toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure\nEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nI ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it\nEven if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter\nI never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to\nI'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader\nMy crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it\nThere's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nI'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object for someone to get killed\nWhy would I want to destroy something I helped build\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\nI went through my whole career with out ever mentioning\nAnd that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth\nAnd talking about something that I knew nothing about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did\nI just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV\nNow I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it\nI understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down, like toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\nAnd wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying\nBut now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\nShit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it\nIt's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him\nFuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it\nMeanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions\nSome receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks\nThat I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication, the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it\nThat motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then\nBut I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think\nThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc\nAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us\nAs soon as we give the orders, never to extort us\nStrictly to show they support us\nMaybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back\nAnd to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more then any award is\nBut I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThen to just say that I

So long, bitch you did me so wrong\nI don't want to go on\nLiving in this world without you On the first page of our story\nThe future seemed so bright\nThen this thing turned out so evil\nI don't know why I'm still surprised\nEven angels have their wicked schemes\nAnd you take that to new extremes\nBut you'll always be my hero\nEven though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices\nGlass is shattered from the fight\nIn this tug of war you'll always win\nEven when I'm right\n'Cause you feed me fables from your hand\nWith violent words and empty threats\nAnd it's sick that all these battles\nAre what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist\nI try to run but I don't wanna ever leave\n'Til the walls are going up\nIn smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face\nSmeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction\nHush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry\nThat you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me\nTry and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me\nRun out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy\nBaby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me\nThen tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me\nThen after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the\nDestructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we\nKnow that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs\nThat we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky\nTogether, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills\nYou hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?\nI may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count\nBut together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain\nOur love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling\nThis house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand\nSquare feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it\n'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie\nLove the way you lie I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see\nSo many motherfuckin' people who feel like me\nWho share the same views and the same exact beliefs\nIt's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me\nSo many lives I touch, so much anger aimed\nIn no particular direction\nJust sprays and sprays\nAnd straight through your radio waves it plays and plays\n'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days\nWho woulda thought\nStanding in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide\nReachin' for a t-shirt to wear\nThat I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?\nHow could I predict my words would have an impact like this\nI must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office\nCause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems\nAnd now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government\nI'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on White America!\nI could be one of your kids\nWhite America!\nLittle Eric looks just like this\nWhite America!\nErica loves my shit\nI go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get\nWhite

studios at\nWhen I was underground\nNo one gave a fuck I was white\nNo labels wanted to sign me\nAlmost gave up, I was like \"Fuck it\"\nUntil I met Dre\nThe only one who looked past\nGave me a chance\nAnd I lit a fire up under his ass\nHelped him get back to the top\nEvery fan black that I got\nWas probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got\nLike damn we just swapped\nSittin'

instantly hooked right in\nAnd they connected wit' me too because I looked like them\nThat's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope\nSearchin' wit' a fine toothed comb\nIt's like this rope waitin' to choke\nTightenin' around my throat\nWatchin' me while I write this like\n\"I dont like this, no!\"\nAll I hear is\nLyrics lyrics constant controversy\nSponsors workin' round the clock\nTo try to stop my concerts early\nSurely hip hop is never a problem\nIn Harlem only in Boston\nAfter it bothered ya fathers\nOf daughters startin' to blossom\nNow I'm catchin' the flack from these

for\nI almost break down and cry\nSometimes I think I'm crazy\nI'm crazy, oh so crazy\nWhy am I here, am I just wastin' my time?\nBut then I see my baby\nSuddenly I'm not crazy\nIt all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over\nBut then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older\nI watch her grow up with pride\nPeople make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me\nThey just don't see my real side\nI act like shit don't phase me\nInside it drives me crazy\nMy insecurities could eat me alive\nBut then I see my baby\nSuddenly I'm not crazy\nIt all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no) Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over\nBut then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter\nIf I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father\nTo show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er\nGod, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort\nNow you probably get

that hurts deep inside o' ma soul\nAnd just know that I grow cold of the older I grow\nThis boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold\nAnd this load is like the weight of the world\nAnd I think my neck is breakin'\nShould I just give up\nOr try to live up to these expectations?\nNow look\nI love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell\nBut I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt\nSo many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else\nBut the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted\nSo here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation\nI've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman\nI've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman\nMan, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?\nWould of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'\nBut fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more\nI got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie\nSo sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya\nOur baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner\nAnd suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted\nIt's like the greatest gift you can get\nThe weight has been lifted\nAnd now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier\nNothin' can take her from me Woo!\nI told you I can't sing\nOh well, I tried\nHailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, daddy will be right

the parkin' lot\nGet into an argument over a parkin' spot\nHe's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off\nMissed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door\nIn St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place\nSprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall\nBefore anyone could even hear the first shot go off\nI'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff\nBullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off\nThank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun\nAnd where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him\nWait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre\nNah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was\nI never saw him run so fast in my life\nLook at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife\nThere she is on the ground bein' trampled\nI go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her\nGod damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit\nMy vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin\nIf I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep\nFollow Bizarre's path and ran through it\nAnd made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps\nLooked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out\nBut I can't see who he's shootin' it out with\nBut Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth [Chorus] It's Friday night came to this bitch right\nBig ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right\nI ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight\nAlthough I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight\nThat's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge\nShot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in\nSwift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker\nShoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker\nSo one shot for the money two's to stop the show\nThird's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go\n(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)\nHe tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece [Chorus] I don't know dude\nI think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude\nAnd I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude\nAnd they need to take it up with me after the show\nBecause These chicks don't even know the name of my band\nBut they're all on me like they wanna hold hands\n'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man\nAll because I'm the lead singer of my band So I get off stage right and drop the mic\nWalk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like\n\"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.\nI'm the lead singer in D12 baby\"\nThey're all like \"Oh my God it's him\"\n\"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem\"\n\"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock\"\n\"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock\"\nAnd by now the rest of the fellas get jealous\nEspecially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas\nAll the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes\nThrow their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage\nSo like every single night they pick a fight with me\nBut when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry\nCuz they're back on stage the next night with me\nDude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me\nYesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me\n'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be\nThis rock star shit, it's the life for me\nAnd all the other guys just despise me because These chicks don't even know the name of my band\nBut they're all on me like they wanna hold hands\n'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man\nAll because I'm the lead singer of my band\nMy band\nMy band\nMy band\nMy band\nMy band\nMy band\nRoxanne\nMy band\nMy

rock, but the group does not\nOnce we sold out arenas to the amusement park\nI'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot\nI should cut his mic off when the musics starts\nReady to snap on a dumbass
