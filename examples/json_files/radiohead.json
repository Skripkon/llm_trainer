rid of itself\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\nIt wears her out\nShe lives with a broken man\nA cracked polystyrene man\nWho just crumbles and burns\nHe used to do surgery\nFor girls in the eighties\nBut gravity always wins\nAnd it wears him out\nIt wears him out\nIt wears him out\nWears him out\nShe looks like the real thing\nShe tastes like the real thing\nMy fake plastic love\nBut I can't help the feeling\nI could blow through the ceiling\nIf I just turn and run\nAnd it wears me out\nIt wears me out\nIt wears me out\nIt wears me out\nAnd if I could be who you wanted\nIf I could be who you wanted\nAll the time\nAll the time\nI'll drown my beliefs\nTo have you be in peace\nI'll dress like your niece\nAnd wash your swollen feet\nJust don't leave\nDon't leave\nI'm not living,\nI'm just killing time\nYour tiny hands\nYour crazy-kitten smile\nJust don't leave\nDon't leave\nAnd true love waits\nIn haunted attics\nAnd true love lives\nOn lollipops and crisps\nJust don't leave\nDon't leave\nJust don't leave\nDon't leave\nAnd in your life, there comes the darkness\nThis spacecraft blocking out the sky\nAnd there's nowhere to hide\nYou run to the back and you cover your ears\nBut it's the loudest sound you've ever heard\nNow we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people\nWe are helpless to resist\nIn your darkest hour\nBut it was just a lie, just a lie\nJust a lie, just a lie\nEven at this angle\nAnd so we crumble\nStill turning heads, you know where it's at\nThis dread still covers us\nYou gotta be kidding me\nThe grass grows over me\nYour face in the glass, and it's dark now\nIt was just a laugh, it was just a laugh\nIt's whatever you say it is\nSplit infinite\nAnd in your life, there comes a darkness\nAnd a spacecraft blocking out the sky\nAnd there's nowhere to hide\nYou run to the back and you cover your ears\nIt's the loudest sound you've ever heard\nIn your darkest hour\nIf you had another one\nIf you had another name\nSo dark\nAre you such a dreamer\nTo put the world to rights\nI'll stay home forever\nWhere two and two always makes a five\nI'll lay down the tracks\nSandbag and hide\nJanuary has April showers\nAnd two and two always makes a five\nIt's the devil's way now\nThere is no way out\nYou can scream and you can shout\nIt is too late now\nBecause you're not there\nPayin' attention\nPayin' attention\nPayin'

then you cut the string\nYou used to be alright\nWhat happened?\nDid the cat get your tongue\nDid your string come undone\nOne by one\nOne by one\nIt comes to us all\nIt's as soft as your pillow\nYou used to be alright\nWhat happened?\nEtcetera etcetera\nFacts for whatever\nFifteen steps\nThen a shear drop\nPlease could you stop the noise\nI'm trying to get some rest\nFrom all the unborn chicken voices in my head\nWhat's that?\nWhat's that?\nWhen I am king, you will be first against the wall\nWith your opinion which is of no consequence at all\nWhat's that?\nWhat's that?\nAmbition makes you

baby's got the bends\nOh, no\nWe don't have any real friends\nNo, no, no\nJust lying in a bar with my drip feed on\nTalking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen\nAnd I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy\nI wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen\nWhere do we go from here?\nThe planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear\nAnd where are you?\nThey brought in the C.I.A\nThe tanks and the whole marines to blow me away\nTo blow me sky-high\nBaby's got the bends\nWe don't have any real friends\nJust lying in a bar with my drip feed on\nTalking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen\nI wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy\nI wish, I wish, I wish that something would-\nI want to live, breathe\nI want to be part of the human race\nI want to live, breathe\nI want to be part of the human race, race, race?\nWhere do we go from here?\nThe words are coming out all weird, where are you now?\nWhen I need you\nSlight of hand\nJump off the end\nInto a clear lake\nNo one around\nJust dragonflies\nFantasize\nNo one gets hurt\nYou've done nothing wrong\nSlide your hand\nJump off the end\nThe water's clear\nAnd innocent\nThe water's

we coming to?\nWhat are we gonna do?\nBlame it on the black star\nBlame it on the falling sky\nBlame it on the satellite that beams me home\nThe troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you\nI try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you\nWhat are we coming to?\nI just don't know anymore\nBlame it on the black star\nBlame it on the falling sky\nBlame it on the satellite that beams me home\nI get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you\nI keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you\nWhat am I coming to?\nI'm gonna melt down\nBlame it on the black star\nBlame it on the falling sky\nBlame it on the satellite that beams me home\nThis is killing me\nThis is killing me\nDon't hurt me\nDon't

elephants\nSitting ducks\nI will\nRise up\nLittle baby's eyes\nEyes, eyes, eyes\nLittle baby's eyes\nEyes, eyes, eyes\nIn the next world war\nIn a jack knifed juggernaut\nI am born again\nIn the neon sign\nScrolling up and down\nI am born again\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the universe\nIn a deep, deep sleep\nOf the innocent\nI am born again\nIn a fast German car\nI'm amazed that I survived\nAn airbag saved my life\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the universe\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the universe\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the

informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism\nWill not cry in public\nLess chance of illness\nTires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat\nA good memory\nStill cries at a good film\nStill kisses with saliva\nNo longer empty and frantic\nLike a cat\nTied to a stick\nThat's driven into\nFrozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness\nCalm, fitter, healthier and more productive\nA pig in a cage on antibiotics\nWhen you were here before\nCouldn't look you in the eye\nYou're just like an angel\nYour skin makes me cry\nYou float like a feather\nIn a beautiful world\nI wish I was special\nYou're so fuckin' special\nBut I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here.\nI don't care if it hurts\nI wanna have control\nI wanna a

I'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here\nI don't belong here\nYou don't wanna talk to me,\nYou don't wanna say the words,\nYou try to get off the hook,\nYou try to get off the hook.\nSprawling on a pin,\nHanging off the hook,\nTrying to get yourself away,\nTrying to get yourself away.\nThere's no use dwelling on,\nOn what might have been,\nJust think of all the fun,\nYou could be having.\nWe know the way you talk,\nWe know what you want,\nWe know what you want,\nWhat you really wanted.\nTake a look around,\nThere's candles on the cake,\nOn what might have been,\nThe road you should have took,\nMistakes mistaken\nThere's no use dwelling on,\nNo use dwelling on.\nIt's such a beautiful day,\nIt's such a beautiful day,\nFind yourself a ????,\nGo and get some rest.\nIt's such a beautiful day.\nIt's such a beautiful day.\nGo up to the mic,\nGo up to the mic,\nGo and get some rest.\nThe breath of the morning\nI keep forgetting\nThe smell of the warm summer air\nI live in a town\nWhere you can't smell a thing\nYou watch your feet\nFor cracks in the pavement\nUp above\nAliens hover\nMaking home movies\nFor the folks back home\nOf all these weird creatures\nWho lock up their spirits\nDrill holes in themselves\nAnd live for their secrets\nThey're all\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nOh\nI wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane\nLate at night when I'm driving\nTake me on board their beautiful ship\nShow me the world as I'd love to see it\nI'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me\nThey'd think that I'd finally lost it completely\nI'd show them the stars and the meaning of life\nThey'd shut me away\nBut I'd be alright\nAlright\nI'm alright\nAlright\nI'm just\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nUptight\nEveryone\nEveryone around here\nEveryone is so near\nIt's holding on\nIt's holding on\nEveryone\nEveryone is so near\nEveryone has got the fear\nIt's holding on\nIt's holding on\nIt's holding on\nIt's holding on\nIt's holding on\nWish that I could come out of the fog\nSuperhero powers\nBurst out of the sand\nin a bunch of flowers\nyou just say the word, apparition comes\nwith a long and winning handsome smile\nwish we could connect\nStep into the fog\nof the diving board\nblend into the light\ndown the cable lines\nroll onto the earth\nreforming on the wind\ntwo places at once\ntaste the air with you\nundo all the ties\nwish that I could flip one of those lies\nlift us on the wind\nsee that stretchy smile\ngo\nRight across your\nFace\nCut a hole (2x)\na hole (2x).\n\n\n\n"}]
