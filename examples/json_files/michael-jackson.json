crowd\n\nI lost my heart\nOn the carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho left my heart in pieces\nLost my heart\nOn The carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho ran away.\n\nI was the clown\nAnd she was the dancer\nWe both knew it wouldn't work\nBut we took our chances\nWhat I can't recall\nIs if there was a girl at all\nOr was it my imagination?\nI still remember\nAll of those faces\nAnd now all I have is memories.\n\nI lost my heart\nOn the carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho left my heart in pieces\nLost my heart\nOn The carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho ran away.\n\nTwo different people\nIn love for an instant\nTo see that the circus came today\nSometimes I can hear the calliope\nAnd I can hear her calling me.\n\nDon't you know?\nI lost my heart\nOn the carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho left my heart in pieces\nLost my heart\nOn The carousel\nTo a circus girl\nWho ran away\n\n\nDon't let it get you down\nWhen you're not on top\nWhere else numbers two\nLet gets up and never stops, no\nAin't double

youth\nHas turned from a fantasy\nInto the truth\nThe moon is the enemy\nTwisting her soul\nAnd taking its fearful toll\nScared of the moon\n\nBut now there are others who sit in a room\nAnd wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom\nTogether they gather\nTheir lunacy shade\nBut knowing just why they're scared\nScared of the moon\n\nScared of the moon\nScared of the moon\nScared of the moon\nScared of the moon\n\n\nAll alone wishing on stars\nWaiting for you to find me\nOne sweet night I knew I would see\nA stranger who'd be my friend\n\nWhen someone in the dark reaches out to
