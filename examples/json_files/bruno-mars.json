been blind\n'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright\nLike my daddy I'm a gambling man\nNever been afraid to roll the dice\nBut when I put my bet on her\nLittle miss snake eyes ruined my life\nShe better sleep with one eye open\nBetter make sure to lock her door\n'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money\nAnd she did it for fun\nNatalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny\nTelling everyone\nWell I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch\nWatch out she's quick\nLook out for a pretty little thing named Natalie\nIf you see her tell her I'm coming\nShe better run The good lord better bless your soul\n'Cause I done already cursed your name\nDon't matter which way you go\nPayback's gonna come your way\nYou'll be begging me, please please please\nAnd now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh\nWhile you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night\nI spend my lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)\nI'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)\nCan't nobody save you now\nSo there ain't no use in trying\nOnce I get my hands on you, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money\nAnd she did it for fun\nNatalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny\nTelling everyone\nWell I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch\nWatch out she's quick\nLook out for a pretty little thing named Natalie\nIf you see her tell her I'm coming\nShe better run I should've known better (I should've known better)\n'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)\nShe never said forever (She never said forever)\nI'm a fool that played her game Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money\nAnd she did it for fun\nNatalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny\nTelling everyone\nWell I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch\nWatch out she's quick\nLook out for a pretty little thing named Natalie\nIf you see her tell her I'm coming\nShe better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated\nYou're as straight as they come\nYou go 'bout your day baby\nWhile I hide from the sun It's better if you don't understand\n'Cause you won't know what it's like\nUntil you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side\nAnd you, all you gotta do is cross the line\nI could wait a whole life time\nBut you just gotta decide\nYou know I, I'll be waiting on the other,\nWaiting on the other side We would live forever\nWho could ask for more\nYou could die if you wanted\nBut baby what for It's better if you don't understand\nAnd you won't know what it's like\nUntil you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side\nAnd you, all you gotta do is cross the line\nI could wait a whole life time\nBut you just gotta decide\nYou know I, I'll be waiting on the other,\nWaiting on the other side If they say life's a dream\nCall this insomnia\n'Cause this ain't Wonderland\nIt damn sure ain't Narnia\nAnd once you cross the line\nYou can't change your mind\nYeah I'm a monster\nBut I'm no Frankenstein\nAnd quite frankly\nI've been feeling insane in between my eyes\nI really can't explain what I feel inside\nIf you knew what I was you'd run and hide\nMany have tried to go into the night\nCross over the line and come back alive\nBut that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side\nAnd you, all you gotta do is cross the line\nI could wait a whole life time\nBut you just gotta decide\nYou know I, I'll be waiting on the other,\nWaiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand\nIt's better if you don't understand\nIt's better if you don't understand\nIt's better if you don't understand\nIt's better if you don't understand\nIt's better if you don't

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman\nI can't fight back the tears in my eyes\nOh, how could I be so lucky\nI must've done something right\nAnd I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello\nFunny how time flies when you're in love\nIt took us a lifetime to find each other\nIt was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman\nI can't fight back the tears in my eyes\nOh how could I be so lucky\nI must've done something right\nAnd I promise to love her for the rest of my life Once again you're home alone\nTears running from your eyes\nAnd I'm on the outside\nKnowing that you're all I want\nBut I can't do anything\nI'm so helpless baby Everyday same old things\nSo used to feelin pain\nNever had real love before\nAnd it ain't her fault She knows better but\nShe can't help it\nWanna tell her\nBut would that be selfish\nHow do you heal\nA heart that can't feel, it's broken\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows You've been livin this way so long\nYou don't know the difference\nAnd it's killing me\nCause you can have so much more\nI'm the one your looking for\nBut you close your eyes on me\nSo you still can't see Everyday same old things\nSo used to feelin pain\nNever had real love before\nAnd it ain't her fault She knows better but\nShe can't help it\nWanna tell her\nBut would that be selfish\nHow do you heal\nA heart that can't feel, it's broken\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows All she knows is the pain\nIn the corner of an empty home\nShe's still comfortable\nI want her to know\nIt can be better than this\nI can't pretend\nWish we were more than friends She knows better but\nShe can't help it\nWanna tell her\nBut would that be selfish\nHow do you heal\nA heart that can't feel, it's broken\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows\nHis love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
