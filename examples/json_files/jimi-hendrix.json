Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,\nWay back up in the woods among the evergreens\nLivin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,\nLived a country boy name of Johnny B.

Go, go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nJohnny B. Goode He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack\nAnd sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.\nOh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,\nPlaying to the music that the drivers made.\nPeople passing by they'd stop and say\nOh my that little country boy could play Go, go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nGo, Johnny go , go\nJohnny B.

Goode I am your trash man-\nThrow out all your trash today-\nClean out your mind today-\nPlease pass the weed\nAnd please take some heed.\nTake your fast glass guns and\nThrow them away.\nThere he goes, hey\nI just the gypsy bandit. Gypsy talk-\nShe has been here 3 times and\nThe 4th time, she was emptied in from\nThe mouth of a bottle.\nSeems like I seen you somewhere before-\nAnd her dog named pig had a red\nNeck shaped just like a cracker\nDipped in rot hole. Address 3rd trash can from the\nLeft. that's where I'll be-\nJust take all your blues\nAnd throw them at my feet.\n-oh that's what friends are for.\nYes I sing the blues for me and you.\nLet me do changes and come back\nAnd tell you. so it won't be so hard\nWhen it's time for you to go through. Anything is possible after an\nEmbarrassing situation- And once you take but all that\nRubbish and hate and-\nLoad it on my truck.\nBut don't make me work late-\nI am your trashman-\nAnd don't forget I also want\nTo live- not just survive-\nI ain't your black slave- just\nBecause I just might try to\nWash out your mind- it's up to\nYour friend-\nTo get up off your rusty behind. And please pass me the peace weed,\nAnd take some heed-\nThrow all that mixed up speed\nAway- all that dirt is gonna clog and\nHurt- man you reach 100 years old in a day-\nI am your trashman-\nI am your trashman-\nI come to keep your houses clean.\nI am the trashman-\nTake out all your dirty blues and\nDreams-\nWell when I come around to\nCollect for the bill,\nThat's when I come around for\nMy pleasure kill... I am the trashman\nYou must have seen me in\nYour t.v.\nI'm here to clean up-\nAll your hang ups or\nCome downs, I'm gonna kill...\nThat's my duty.\nSo please don't try to make\nMe crawl up no hill. May I whisper in your ear...\nSay something you ought to hear...\nLots of people so dear\nThey're getting hurt... \"lady's and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience.\" \"I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. dig,\nDig, I'd like to get something strait, we umm we got tired\nOf the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing\nOur minds too much, so we decided to change everything around.\nAnd a call it 'gypsy sons and rainbows' for short nothin' but\nA band of gypsies. we have billy cox playin' bass, and um from\nNashville Tennessee we have lary lee playin' guitar over there,\nWe got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny\nGoose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we\nGot jerry velez on congos too. you got yours truly on Pete Whistle,\nWhat me worry? gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok.\nLike we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary\nRhythm thing. (someone in the background) I have mine thank you\nI have mine thank you, baby.\" Black is gold is pure\nAnd true kings of this earth. 1. So I say it's up to us to straighten\nOut this mess...\nWe got to go through hell...\nAnd then that's the last of this\nMiserable test... 2. Black must be bold\nBecause it's gold and true\nKings of this world...\nSo let them go to the moon.\nYes let them go to mars.\nBecause deep down inside\nThey're really from the stars. 3. That's why they don't want\nUs to mix...just the way\nThe word of God had said.\nSo let them go to saturn...that's\nWhere they'll learn instead.\nBecause black and white\nTogether is right...\nAnd white by itself is\nAn egotistic elf. 4. So they show you how to\nKill...and if you don't\nThey will.\nWhat do they know about\nHappiness...\nHow can they about life...\nThey just got lost in space.\nSo when they landed,\nAtlantis cried. So if they're so alone try\nTo make them feel at home.\nSo let them fetch you fire wood.\nAnd let them nibble on the bone.\nSo invent a word called love.\nAnd then they blame our mistakes on god.\nDon't you know how lonely they must be.\nSo many light years from home.\nHey soulful people I'm calling.\nDon't be no more slaves.\nBecause God will protect us\nWhen it comes to doomsday.\nRealize before it's too late...\nThat no one on earth will escape.\nWe are the kings of earth.\nAnd axis gonna put them slaves...\nThey killed so many worlds before.\nBut they will pass sentence upon themselves...\nWhen the earth opens up...will\nThey be saved from our hell. I feel the truth of life.\nWe better all realize...\nPeople like me and you\nWe feel so bad, don't know\nWhat to do... they keep us\nHigh low on drugs.\nAnd they got us making their rugs...\nAs we go dripping blood.\nBut the sun knows as\nThe wind blows and the\nFire grows towards the\nFar shores and the water\nFoams to make steamed\nBones of all of those who don't belive that...\nBlack is gold is the kings of this world.\nWe all better get our places\nBefore God tells us to our\nFace we are...past the human race.\nLet's pray that we all agree\nWe got to straighten out the family tree.\nLife is for you and me togather.\nThat's the way it was meant to be.\nWhite man watch your mouth\nBecause our drums, they face the south.\nAnd you can't kill the god\nThat kept you alive between\nThe poles of the north and south.\nYou better adjust your place\nIn this world...before your\nHair, it starts to curl...and the\nYellow, red, and black of this\nWorld will tear your ass and soul apart. Where is he coming from ?\nFrom heaven where 1,000,000\nWorlds are one.\nWhere is he going to ?\nHe's going to make contact\nWith the living and the dead...\nHere comes black gold...\nGather round young and old...\nHe's going to be felt by the\nTimid and the bold...\nWithin a wink of an eye, With the wink of an eye\nEgos swell, bust and die...\nKingdoms fall and cry...\nWith the wink of an eye...\nWith the wink of an eye\nA new born baby cries...\nAnd a 100 soldiers die with\nThe wink of an eye.
