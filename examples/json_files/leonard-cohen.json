[{"text": "Now I've heard there was a secret chord\nThat David played, and it pleased the Lord\nBut you don't really care for music, do you?\nIt goes like this\nThe fourth, the fifth\nThe minor fall, the major lift\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew her\nShe tied you\nTo a kitchen chair\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah You say I took the name in vain\nI don't even know the name\nBut if I did, well really, what's it to you?\nThere's a blaze of light\nIn every word\nIt doesn't matter which you heard\nThe holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much\nI couldn't feel, so I tried to touch\nI've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you\nAnd even

that you have no love to give her\nThen he gets you on her wavelength\nAnd she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind\nAnd you know that she will trust you\nFor you've touched her perfect body with your mind And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water\nAnd he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower\nAnd when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him\nHe said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them\nBut he himself was broken, long before the sky would open\nForsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind\nAnd you think you maybe you'll trust him\nFor he's touched your perfect body with her mind Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river\nShe's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters\nAnd the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor\nAnd she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers\nThere are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning\nThey are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever\nWhile Suzanne holds her mirror And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind\nAnd you know that you can trust her\nFor she's touched your perfect body with her mind

calvary\n\"do you hate mankind for what they done to you? \"\nHe said, \"talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.\nI've so little time and I'm only passing through.\" Passing through, passing through.\nSometimes happy, sometimes blue,\nGlad that I ran into you.\nTell the people that you saw me passing through. I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,\nI said \"now you're out, what are you going to do? \"\n\"plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.\nI'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through.\" Passing through, passing through ... I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.\nI said, \"how come the men here suffer like they do? \"\n\"men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right\nEven though they know they're only passing through\" Passing through, passing through ... I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.\nHe said, \"one world must come out of world war two\" (ah, the fool)\n\"yankee, russian, white or tan,\" he said, \"a man is still a man.\nWe're all on one road, and we're only passing through.\" Passing through, passing through ... (let's do it one more time) Passing through, passing through ... The birds they sang\nAt the break of day\nStart again\nI heard them say\nDon't dwell on what\nHas passed away\nOr what is yet to be\nYeah the wars they will\nBe fought again\nThe holy dove\nShe will be caught again\nBought and sold\nAnd bought again\nThe dove is never free Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring\nForget your perfect offering\nThere is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)\nThat's how the light gets in We asked for signs\nThe signs were sent\nThe birth betrayed\nThe marriage spent\nYeah the widowhood\nOf every government\nSigns for all to see I can't run no more\nWith that lawless crowd\nWhile the killers in high places\nSay their prayers out loud\nBut they've summoned, they've summoned up\nA thundercloud\nAnd they're going to hear from me (Ring, ring, ring, ring)\nRing the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering\nThere is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)\nThat's how the light gets in You can add up the parts\nYou won't have the sum\nYou can strike up the march\nThere is no drum\nEvery heart, every heart to love will come\nBut like a refugee (Ring, ring, ring, ring)\nRing the bells that still can ring\nForget your perfect offering\nThere is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)\nThat's how the light gets in\nRing the bells that still can ring (ring the bells that still can ring)\nForget your perfect offering\nThere is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)\nThat's how the light gets in\nThat's how the light gets in\nThat's how the light gets in Come over to the window, my little darling\nI'd like to try to read your palm\nI used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy\nBefore I let you take me home Now so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again Well, you know that I love to live with you\nBut you make me forget so very much\nI forget to pray for the angels\nAnd then the angels forget to pray for us Now so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again We met when we were almost young\nDeep in the green lilac park\nYou held on to me like I was a crucifix\nAs we went kneeling through the dark Oh, so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now\nThen why do I feel alone?\nI'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web\nIs fastening my ankle to a stone Now so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again For now I need your hidden love\nI'm cold as a new razorblade\nYou left when I told you I was curious\nI never said that I was brave Oh, so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again Oh, you are really such a pretty one\nI see you've gone and changed your name again\nAnd just when I climbed this whole mountainside\nTo wash my eyelids in the rain Oh, so long, Marianne\nIt's time that we began to laugh\nAnd cry and cry and laugh about it all again I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm\nYour hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm\nYes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new\nIn city and in forest they smiled like me and you\nBut now it's come to distances and both of us must try\nYour eyes are soft with sorrow\nHey, that's no way to say goodbye I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time\nWalk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme\nYou know my love goes with you as your love stays with me\nIt's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea\nBut let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie\nYour eyes are soft with sorrow\nHey, that's no way to say goodbye I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm\nYour hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm\nYes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new\nIn city and in forest they smiled like me and you\nBut let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie\nYour eyes are soft with sorrow\nHey, that's no way to say goodbye You came to me this morning\nAnd you handled me like meat\nYou?d have to be a man to know\nHow good that feels, how sweet My mirror twin, my next of kin\nI?d know you in my sleep\nAnd who but you would take me in\nA thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened\nLike a lily to the heat\nYou see I?m just another snowman\nStanding in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love\nHis secondhand physique\nWith all he is and all he was\nA thousand kisses deep I know you had to lie to me\nI know you had to cheat\nTo pose all hot and high\nBehind the veils of sheer deceit Our perfect porn aristocrat\nSo elegant and cheap\nI?m old but I?m still into that\nA thousand kisses deep I?m good at love, I?m good at hate\nIt?s in between I freeze\nBeen working out but it?s too late\n(It?s been too late for years) But you look good, you really do\nThey love you on the street\nIf you were here I?d kneel for you\nA thousand kisses deep The autumn moved across your skin\nGot something in my eye\nA light that doesn?t need to live\nAnd doesn?t need to die A riddle in the book of love\nObscure and obsolete\nAnd witnessed here in time and blood\nA thousand kisses deep But I?m still working with the wine\nStill dancing cheek to cheek\nThe band is playing Auld Lang Syne\nBut the heart will not retreat I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray\nI never had their sweet\nBut once or twice they let me play\nA thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened\nLike a lily to the heat\nYou see I?m just another snowman\nStanding in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love\nHis secondhand physique\nWith all he is and all he was\nA thousand kisses deep But you don?t need to hear me now\nAnd every word I speak\nIt counts against me anyhow\nA thousand kisses deep Like a bird on the wire\nLike a drunk in a midnight choir\nI have tried in my way to be free Like a worm on a hook\nLike a knight from some old-fashioned book\nI have saved all my ribbons for thee\nIf I, if I have been unkind\nI hope that you can just let it go by\nIf I, if I have been untrue\nI hope you know it was never to you For like a baby, stillborn\nLike a beast with his horn\nI have torn everyone who reached out for me\nBut I swear by this song\nAnd by all that I have done wrong\nI will make it all up to thee I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch\nHe said to me, \"you must not ask for so much\"\nAnd a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door\nShe cried to me, \"hey, why not ask for more?\"\nOh, like a bird on the wire\nLike a drunk in a midnight choir\nI have tried in my way to be free It's true that all the men you knew were dealers\nWho said they were through with dealing\nEvery time you gave them shelter\nI know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone\nWho is reaching for the sky just to surrender\nWho is reaching for the sky just to surrender And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind\nYou find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter\nLike any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild\nHe'll never need to deal another\nHe was just some Joseph looking for a manger\nHe was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill\nHe'll say one day you caused his will\nTo weaken with your love and warmth and shelter\nAnd then taking from his wallet\nAn old schedule of trains, he'll say\nI told you when I came I was a stranger But now another stranger seems\nTo want you to ignore his dreams\nAs though they were the burden of some other\nOh, you've seen that man before\nHis golden arm dispatching cards\nBut now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger\nAnd he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter\nYes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter Ah, you hate to see another tired man\nLay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker\nAnd while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice there's a highway\nThat is curling up like smoke above his shoulder\nIt's curling just like smoke above his shoulder You tell him to come in sit down\nBut something makes you turn around\nThe door is open you can't close your shelter\nYou try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid\nIt's you my love, you who are the stranger\nIt is you my love, you who are the stranger Well, I've been waiting, I was sure\nWe'd meet between the trains we're waiting for\nI think it's time to board another\nPlease understand, I never had a secret chart\nTo get me to the heart of this or any other matter\nWell, he talks like this you don't know what he's after\nWhen he speaks like this you don't know what he's after Let's meet tomorrow if you choose\nUpon the shore, beneath the bridge\nThat they are building on some endless river\nThen he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm\nYou realize, he's only advertising one more shelter\nAnd it comes to you, he never was a stranger\nAnd you say okay, the bridge or someplace later And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind\nYou find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter\nLike any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild\nHe'll never need to deal another\nHe was just some Joseph looking for a manger\nHe was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill\nHe'll say one day you caused his will\nTo weaken with your love and warmth and shelter\nAnd then taking from his wallet\nAn old schedule of trains, he'll say\nI told you when I came I was a stranger\nI told you when I came I was a stranger\nI told you when I came I was a stranger\nI told you when I came I was a stranger Give me back my broken night\nMy mirrored room, my secret life\nIt's lonely here,\nThere's no one left to torture\nGive me absolute control\nOver every living soul\nAnd lie beside me, baby\nThat's an order Give me crack and anal sex\nTake the only tree that's left\nAnd stuff it up the hole\nIn your culture\nGive me back the Berlin wall\nGive me Stalin and St. Paul\nI've seen the future, brother\nIt is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions\nWon't be nothing\nNothing you can measure anymore\nThe blizzard, the blizzard of the world\nHas crossed the threshold\nAnd it has overturned\nThe order of the soul\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant You don't know me from the wind\nYou never will, you never did\nI'm the little Jew\nWho wrote the Bible\nI've seen the nations rise and fall\nI've heard their stories, heard them all\nBut love's the only engine of survival\nYour servant here, he has been told\nTo say it clear, to say it cold\nIt's over, it ain't going\nAny further\nAnd now the wheels of heaven stop\nYou feel the devil's riding crop\nGet ready for the future\nIt is murder Things are going to slide\nSlide in all directions\nWon't be nothing\nNothing you can measure anymore\nThe blizzard, the blizzard of the world\nHas crossed the threshold\nAnd it has overturned\nThe order of the soul\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they meant There'll be the breaking of the ancient\nWestern code\nYour private life will suddenly explode\nThere'll be phantoms\nThere'll be fires on the road\nAnd the white man dancing\nYou'll see a woman\nHanging upside down\nHer features covered by her fallen gown\nAnd all the lousy little poets\nComing round\nTryin' to sound like Charlie Manson\nAnd the white man dancin' Give me back the Berlin wall\nGive me Stalin and St. Paul\nGive me Christ or give me Hiroshima\nDestroy another fetus now\nWe don't like children anyhow\nI've seen the future, baby\nit is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions\nWon't be nothing\nNothing you can measure anymore\nThe blizzard, the blizzard of the world\nHas crossed the threshold\nAnd it has overturned\nThe order of the soul\nWhen they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)\nI wonder what they

said) repent (repent), repent (repent) In my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life I saw you this morning\nYou were moving so fast\nCan't seem to loosen my grip\nOn the past\nAnd I miss you so much\nThere's no one in sight\nAnd we're still making love\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life I smile when I'm angry\nI cheat and I lie\nI do what I have to do\nTo get by\nBut I know what is wrong\nAnd I know what is right\nAnd I'd die for the truth\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life Hold on, hold on, my brother\nMy sister, hold on tight\nI finally got my orders\nI'll be marching through the morning\nMarching through the night\nMoving cross the borders\nOf my secret life Looked through the paper\nMakes you wanna cry\nNobody cares if the people\nLive or die\nAnd the dealer wants you thinking\nThat it's either black or white\nThank God it's not that simple\nIn my secret life I bite my lip\nI buy what I'm told\nFrom the latest hit\nTo the wisdom of old\nBut I'm always alone\nAnd my heart is like ice\nAnd it's crowded and cold\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life\nIn my secret life I'm slowing down the tune\nI never liked it fast\nYou want to get there soon\nI want to get there last It's not because I'm old\nIt's not the life I led\nI always liked it slow\nThat's what my momma said I'm lacing up my shoe\nBut I don't want to run\nI'll get here when I do\nDon't need no starting gun It's not because I'm old\nAnd it's not what dying does\nI always liked it slow\nSlow is in my blood I always liked it slow:\nI never liked it fast\nWith you it's got to go:\nWith me it's got to last It's not because I'm old\nIt's not because I'm dead\nI always liked it slow\nThat's what my momma said All your moves are swift\nAll your turns are tight\nLet me catch my breath\nI thought we had all night I like to take my time\nI like to linger as it flies\nA weekend on your lips\nA lifetime in your eyes I always liked it slow:\nI never liked it fast\nWith you it's got to go:\nWith me it's got to last It's not because I'm old\nIt's not the life I led\nI always liked it slow\nThat's what my momma said I'm slowing down the tune\nI never liked it fast\nYou want to get there soon\nI want to get there last So baby let me go\nYou're wanted back in town\nIn case they want to know\nI'm just trying to slow it down The ponies run, the girls are young\nThe odds are there to beat\nYou win a while and then it's done\nYour little winning streak\nAnd summoned now to deal\nWith your invincible defeat\nYou live your life as if it's real\nA thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed\nI'm back on boogie street\nYou lose your grip and then you slip\nInto the masterpiece\nAnd maybe I had miles to drive\nAnd promises to keep\nYou ditch it all to stay alive\nA thousand kisses deep And sometimes when the night is slow\nThe wretched and the meek\nWe gather up our hearts and go\nA thousand kisses deep Confined to sex we pressed against\nThe limits of the sea\nI saw there were no oceans left\nFor scavengers like me\nI made it to the forward deck\nI blessed our remnant fleet\nAnd then consented to be wrecked\nA thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed\nI'm back on boogie street\nI guess they won't exchange the gifts\nThat you were meant to keep\nAnd quiet is the thought of you\nThe file on you complete\nExcept what we forgot to do\nA thousand kisses deep And sometimes when the night is slow\nThe wretched and the meek\nWe gather up our hearts and go\nA thousand kisses deep The ponies run, the girls are young\nThe odds are there to beat\nYou win a while and then it's done\nYour little winning streak\nAnd summoned now to deal\nWith your invincible defeat\nYou live your life as if it's real\nA thousand kisses deep I love to speak with Leonard\nHe's a sportsman and a shepherd\nHe's a lazy bastard\nLiving in a suit But he does say what I tell him\nEven though it isn't welcome\nHe just doesn't have the freedom\nTo refuse He will speak these words of wisdom\nLike a sage, a man of vision\nThough he knows he's really nothing\nBut the brief elaboration of a tube Going home\nWithout my sorrow\nGoing home\nSometime tomorrow\nGoing home\nTo where it's better\nThan before Going home\nWithout my burden\nGoing home\nBehind the curtain\nGoing home\nWithout the costume\nThat I wore He wants to write a love song\nAn anthem of forgiving\nA manual for living with defeat A cry above the suffering\nA sacrifice recovering\nBut that isn't what I need him\nTo complete I want to make him certain\nThat he doesn't have a burden\nThat he doesn't need a vision\nThat he only has permission\nTo do my instant bidding\nWhich is to say what I have told him\nTo repeat Going home\nWithout my sorrow\nGoing home\nSometime tomorrow\nGoing home\nTo where it's better\nThan before Going home\nWithout my burden\nGoing home\nBehind the curtain\nGoing home\nWithout this costume\nThat I wore I'm going home\nWithout the sorrow\nGoing home\nSometime tomorrow\nGoing home\nTo where it's better\nThan before Going home\nWithout my burden\nGoing home\nBehind the curtain\nGoing home\nWithout this costume\nThat I wore I love to speak with Leonard\nHe's a sportsman and a shepherd\nHe's a lazy bastard\nLiving in a suit If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game\nIf you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame\nIf thine is the glory then mine must be the shame\nYou want it darker\nWe kill the flame Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name\nVilified, crucified, in the human frame\nA million candles burning for the help that never came\nYou want it darker Hineni, hineni\nI'm ready, my lord There's a lover in the story\nBut the story's still the same\nThere's a lullaby for suffering\nAnd a paradox to blame\nBut it's written in the scriptures\nAnd it's not some idle claim\nYou want it darker\nWe kill the flame They're lining up the prisoners\nAnd the guards are taking aim\nI struggled with some demons\nThey were middle class and tame\nI didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim\nYou want it darker Hineni, hineni\nI'm ready, my lord Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name\nVilified, crucified, in the human frame\nA million candles burning for the love that never came\nYou want it darker\nWe kill the flame If you are the dealer, let me out of the game\nIf you are the healer, I'm broken and lame\nIf thine is the glory, mine must be the shame\nYou want it darker Hineni, hineni\nHineni, hineni\nI'm ready, my lord Hineni\nHineni, hineni\nHineni They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom\nFor trying to change the system from within\nI'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them\nFirst we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'm guided by a signal in the heavens (guided, guided)\nI'm guided by this birthmark on my skin (guided, guided by)\nI'm guided by the beauty of our weapons (guided)\nFirst we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I'd really like to live beside you, baby)\n(I love your body and your spirit and your clothes)\n(But you see that line there moving through the station?)\n(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) Ah, you loved me as a loser\nBut now you're worried that I just might win\nYou know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline\nHow many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin\nFirst we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I don't like your fashion business, mister\nAnd I don't like these drugs that keep you thin\nI don't like what happened to my sister\nFirst we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I'd really like to live beside you, baby)\n(I love your body and your spirit and your clothes)\n(But you see that line there moving through the station?)\n(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) And I thank you for those items that you sent me, ha ha ha\nThe monkey and the plywood violin\nI practiced every night, now I'm ready\nFirst we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I am guided) Ah remember me, I used to live for music

water\nWho in the sunshine, who in the night time\nWho by high ordeal, who by common trial\nWho in your merry-merry month of may\nWho by very slow decay\nAnd who shall I say is calling? And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate\nWho in these realms of love, who by something blunt\nWho by avalanche, who by powder\nWho for his greed, who for his hunger\nAnd who shall I say is calling? And who by brave assent, who by accident\nWho in solitude, who in this mirror\nWho by his lady's command, who by his own hand\nWho in mortal chains, who in power\nAnd who shall I say is calling? If you want a lover\nI'll do anything you ask me to\nAnd if you want another kind of love\nI'll wear a mask for you\nIf you want a partner, take my hand, or\nIf you want to strike me down in anger\nHere I stand\nI'm your man If you want a boxer\nI will step into the ring for you\nAnd if you want a doctor\nI'll examine every inch of you\nIf you want a driver, climb inside\nOr if you want to take me for a ride\nYou know you can\nI'm your man Ah, the moon's too bright\nThe chain's too tight\nThe beast won't go to sleep\nI've been running through these promises to you\nThat I made and I could not keep\nAh, but a man never got a woman back\nNot by begging on his knees\nOr I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet\nAnd I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat\nAnd I'd claw at your heart, and I'd tear at your sheet\nI'd say please (please)\nI'm your man And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road\nI will steer for you\nAnd if you want to work the street alone\nI'll disappear for you\nIf you want a father for your child\nOr only want to walk with me a while across the sand\nI'm your man If you want a lover\nI'll do anything you ask me to\nAnd if you want another kind of love\nI'll wear a mask for you You can dance every dance with the guy\nWho gives you the eye, let him hold you tight\nYou can smile every smile for the man\nWho held your hand 'neath the pale moon light\nBut don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin' save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine\nLike sparklin' wine, go and have your fun\nLaugh and sing, but while we're apart\nDon't give your heart to anyone\nBut don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darlin' save the last dance for me Baby, don't you know I love you so\nCan't you feel it when we touch?\nI will never, never let you go\nI love you, oh so much You can dance, go and carry on\n'Till the night is gone\nAnd it's time to go\nIf he asks if you're all alone\nCan he walk you home, you must tell him no\n'Cause don't forget who's taking you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSave the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine\nLike sparklin' wine, go and have your fun\nLaugh and sing, but while we're apart\nDon't give your heart to anyone And don't forget who's takin' you home\nAnd in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darling, save the last dance for me So don't forget who's taking you home\nOr in whose arms you're gonna be\nSo darling, save the last dance for me Oh baby, won't you save the last dance for me?\nOh baby, won't you promise that you'll save\nThe last dance for me>\nSave the last dance, the very last dance for me Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women\nThere's a shoulder where Death comes to cry\nThere's a lobby with nine hundred windows\nThere's a tree where the doves go to die\nThere's a piece that was torn from the morning\nAnd it hangs in the Gallery of Frost I, I-I-I\nTake this waltz, take this waltz\nTake this waltz with the clamp on its jaws Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you\nOn a chair with a dead magazine\nIn the cave at the tip of the lilly\nIn some hallway where love's never been\nOn a bed where the moon has been sweating\nIn a cry filled with footsteps and sand I, I-I-I\nTake this waltz, take this waltz\nTake its broken waist in your hand This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz\nWith its very own breath of brandy and Death\nDragging its tail in the sea There's a concert hall in Vienna\nWhere your mouth had a thousand reviews\nThere's a bar where the boys have stopped talking\nThey've been sentenced to death by the blues\nAh, but who is it climbs to your picture\nWith a garland of freshly cut tears? I, I-I-I\nTake this waltz, take this waltz\nTake this waltz, it's been dying for years There's an attic where children are playing\nWhere I've got to lie down with you soon\nIn a dream of Hungarian lanterns\nIn the mist of some sweet afternoon\nAnd I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow\nAll your sheep and your lillies of snow I, I-I-I\nTake this waltz, take this waltz\nWith its \"I'll never forget you, you know!\" This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz\nWith its very own breath of brandy and Death\nDragging its tail in the sea And I'll dance with you in Vienna\nI'll be wearing a river's disguise\nThe hyacinth wild on my shoulder\nMy mouth on the dew of your thighs\nAnd I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook\nWith the photographs there, and the moss\nAnd I'll yield to the flood of your beauty\nMy cheap violin and my cross\nAnd you'll carry me down on your dancing\nTo the pools that you lift on your wrist\nOh my love, oh my love\nTake this waltz, take this waltz\nIt's yours now, it's all that there is (La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(La-la-la, la-la-la)\n(I, I-I-I) Baby, I've been waiting,\nI've been waiting night and day\nI didn't see the time,\nI waited half my life away\nThere were lots of invitations\nAnd I know you sent me some\nBut I was waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come\nI know you really loved me\nBut, you see, my hands were tied\nAnd I know it must have hurt you,\nIt must have hurt your pride\nTo have to stand beneath my window\nWith your bugle and your drum\nAnd me I'm up there waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah I don't believe you'd like it,\nYou wouldn't like it here\nThere ain't no entertainment\nAnd the judgments are severe\nThe Maestro says it's Mozart\nBut it sounds like bubble gum\nWhen you're waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come Waiting for the miracle\nThere's nothing left to do\nI haven't been this happy\nSince the end of World War II Nothing left to do\nWhen you know that you've been taken\nNothing left to do\nWhen you're begging for a crumb\nNothing left to do\nWhen you've got to go on waiting\nWaiting for the miracle to come I dreamed about you, baby\nIt was just the other night\nMost of you was naked\nAh but some of you was light\nThe sands of time were falling\nFrom your fingers and your thumb\nAnd you were waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah baby, let's get married\nWe've been alone too long\nLet's be alone together\nLet's see if we're that strong\nYeah let's do something crazy,\nSomething absolutely wrong\nWhile we're waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come Nothing left to do\nWhen you know that you've been taken\nNothing left to do\nWhen you're begging for a crumb\nNothing left to do\nWhen you've got to go on waiting\nWaiting for the miracle to come When you've fallen on the highway\nAnd you're lying in the rain,\nAnd they ask you how you're doing\nOf course you'll say you can't complain\nIf you're squeezed for information,\nThat's when you've got to play it dumb\nYou just say you're out there waiting\nFor the miracle, for the miracle to come You got me singing\nEven tho' the news is bad\nYou got me singing\nThe only song I ever had You got me singing\nEver since the river died\nYou got me thinking\nOf the places we could hide You got me singing\nEven though the world is gone\nYou got me thinking\nI'd like to carry on You got me singing\nEven tho' it all looks grim\nYou got me singing\nThe Hallelujah hymn You got me singing\nLike a prisoner in a jail\nYou got me singing\nLike my pardon's in the mail You got me wishing\nOur little love would last\nYou got me thinking\nLike those people of the past You got me singing\nEven though the world is gone\nYou got me thinking\nI'd like to carry on You got me singing\nEven tho' it all went wrong\nYou got me singing\nThe Hallelujah song Whither thou goest, I will go;\nWherever thou lodgest, I will lodge:\nThy people shall be my people ...\nWhither thou goest, I will go. (taken from the Book of Ruth, ch.1; v. 16) Ah we're drinking and we're dancing\nAnd the band is really happening\nAnd the Johnny Walker wisdom running high\nAnd my very sweet companion\nShe's the angel of compassion\nShe's rubbing half the world against her thigh\nAnd every drinker every dancer\nLifts a happy face to thank her\nThe fiddler fiddles something so sublime\nAll the women tear their blouses off\nAnd the men they dance on the polka-dots\nAnd it's partner found, it's partner lost\nAnd it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops\nIt's closing time\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time) Yeah the women tear their blouses off\nAnd the men they dance on the polka-dots\nAnd it's partner found, it's partner lost\nAnd it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops\nIt's closing time Ah we're lonely, we're romantic\nAnd the cider's laced with acid\nAnd the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?\nAnd the moon is swimming naked\nAnd the summer night is fragrant\nWith a mighty expectation of relief\nSo we struggle and we stagger\nDown the snakes and up the ladder\nTo the tower where the blessed hours chime\nAnd I swear it happened just like this\nA sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss\nThe gates of love they budged an inch\nI can't say much has happened since\nBut closing time\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time) I swear it happened just like this\nA sigh, a

that doesn't make a fool of me\nYou were in it for your beauty too\nAnd I loved you for your body\nThere's a voice that sounds like god to me\nDeclaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you\nAnd I loved you when our love was blessed\nAnd I love you now there's nothing left\nBut sorrow and a sense of overtime\nAnd I missed you since the place got wrecked\nAnd I just don't care what happens next\nLooks like freedom but it feels like death\nIt's something in between, I guess\nIt's closing time\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time) Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked\nBy the winds of change and the weeds of sex\nLooks like freedom but it feels like death\nIt's something in between, I guess\nIt's closing time Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing\nBut there's nothing really happening\nAnd the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night\nAnd my very close companion\nGets me fumbling gets me laughing\nShe's a hundred but she's wearing\nSomething tight\nAnd I lift my glass to the awful truth\nWhich you can't reveal to the ears of youth\nExcept to say it isn't worth a dime\nAnd the whole damn place goes crazy twice\nAnd it's once for the devil and once for Christ\nBut the boss don't like these dizzy heights\nWe're busted in the blinding lights\nOf closing time\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time)\n(Closing time) The whole damn place goes crazy twice\nAnd it's once for the devil and once for Christ\nBut the boss don't like these dizzy heights\nWe're busted in the blinding lights\n(Busted in the blinding lights)\nBusted in the blinding lights\nOf closing time\nClosing time Oh the women tear their blouses off\nAnd the men they dance on the polka-dots\nIt's closing time\nAnd it's partner found, it's partner lost\nAnd it's

there's nothing left\nBut closing time\nI miss you since the place got wrecked\nBy the winds of change and the weeds of sex Oh, the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone\nThey were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on\nAnd they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song\nOh, I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long Yes, you who must leave everything that you cannot control\nIt begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul\nWell, I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned\nWhen you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned Well, they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them\nThey touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem\nIf your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn\nThey will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon\nDon't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon\nAnd you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night\nWe weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right\nWe weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right Store Room Its not the wind that keeps you up,\nIts not the snow\nIts not the moon\ncoming like a headlight\nthrough your window\nIts not the thumbnail of

bedrooms of the poor\nAnd there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong\nYou see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song I see you standing on the other side\nI don't know how the river got so wide\nI loved you baby, way back when\nAnd all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed\nBut I feel so close to everything that we lost\nWe'll never, we'll never have to lose it again Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back\nThey're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track\nBut you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone\nI'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is gray\nI ache in the places where I used to play\nAnd I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on\nI'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel\nYou were talking so brave and so free\nGiving me head on the unmade bed\nWhile the limousines wait in the street\nAnd those were the reasons and that was New York\nI was running for the money and the flesh\nThat was called love for the workers in song\nIt still is for those of us left.\nBut you got away, didn't you, baby?\nYou just threw it all to the crowd\nYou got away, they can't pay you now\nFor making your sweet little song\nI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,\nIn the winter of 67\nMy friends of that year they were all trying to go queer\nAnd me I was just getting even\nAnd those were the reasons and that was New York\nI was running for the money and the flesh\nThat was called love for the workers in song\nIt still is for those of us left\nBut you got away, didn't you, baby?\nYou just threw it all to the crowd\nYou got away, they can't pay you now\nFor making your sweet little song I loved you for a long, long time\nI know this love is real\nIt don't matter how it all went wrong\nThat don't change the way I feel\nAnd I can't believe that time is\nGonna heal this wound I'm speaking of\nThere ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I'm aching for you baby\nI can't pretend I'm not\nI need to see you naked\nIn your body and your thought\nI've got you like a habit\nAnd I'll never get enough\nThere ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love (There ain't no cure for love)\n(There ain't no cure for love)\nAll the rocket ships are climbing through the sky\nThe holy books are open wide\nThe doctors working day and night\nBut they'll never ever find that cure for love\n(There ain't no drink, no drug) ah, tell them, angels\n(There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love) I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus\nI see you lying down with me, I see you waking up\nI see your hand, I see your hair\nYour bracelets and your brush\nAnd I call to you, I call to you\nBut I don't call soft enough\nThere ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I walked into this empty church, I had no place else to go\nWhen the sweetest voice I ever heard whispered to my soul\nI don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much\nIt's written in the scriptures\nIt's written there in blood\nAnd I even heard the angels declare it from above\nThere ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love (There ain't no cure for love)\n(There ain't no cure for love)\nAll the rocket ships are climbing through the sky\nThe holy books are open wide\nThe doctors working day and night\nBut they'll never-ever find that (cure for love), that cure for love\n(That cure for love)\n(There ain't no cure for love)\n(No cure for love, there ain't no cure for love) There was a child named Bernadette\nI heard the story long ago\nShe saw the Queen of Heaven once\nAnd kept the vision in her soul\nNo one believed what she had seen\nNo one believed what she heard\nBut there were sorrows to be here\nAnd mercy, mercy in this world So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine\nTorn by what we've done and can't undo\nI just want to hold you, come on let me hold you\nLike Bernadette would do We've been around, we fall, we fly\nWe mostly fall, we mostly run\nAnd every now and then we try\nTo mend the damage that we've done\nTonight, tonight I just can't rest\nI've got this joy inside my breast\nTo think that I did not forget that child\nThat song of Bernadette So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine\nTorn by what we've done and can't undo\nI just want to hold you, won't let me hold you\nLike Bernadette would do\nI just want to hold you, come on let me hold you\nLike Bernadette would do The war was lost\nThe treaty signed\nI was not caught\nI crossed the line I was not caught\nThough many tried\nI live among you\nWell disguised I had to leave\nMy life behind\nI dug some graves\nYou'll never find The story's told\nWith facts and lies\nI have a name\nBut nevermind Nevermind\nNevermind\nThe war was lost\nThe treaty signed There's truth that lives\nAnd truth that dies\nI don't know which\nSo nevermind Your victory\nWas so complete\nSome among you\nThought to keep A record of\nOur little lives\nThe clothes we wore\nOur spoons, our knives The games of luck\nOur soldiers played\nThe stones we cut\nThe songs we made Our law of peace\nWhich understands\nA husband leads\nA wife commands And all of this\nExpressions of\nThe sweet indifference\nSome call love The high indifference\nSome call fate\nBut we had names\nMore intimate Names so deep and\nNames so true\nThey're blood to me\nThey're dust to you There is no need\nThat this survive\nThere's truth that lives\nAnd truth that dies Nevermind\nNevermind\nI live the life\nI left behind There's truth that lives\nAnd truth that dies\nI don't know which\nSo nevermind I could not kill\nThe way you kill\nI could not hate\nI tried I failed You turned me in\nAt least you tried\nYou side with them\nWhom you despise This was your heart\nThis swarm of flies\nThis was once your mouth\nThis bowl of lies You serve them well\nI'm not surprised\nYou're of their kin\nYou're of their kind Nevermind\nNevermind\nI had to leave my life behind\nThe story's told\nWith facts and lies\nYou own the world\nSo nevermind Nevermind\nNevermind\nI live the life\nI left behind I live it full\nI live it wide\nThrough layers of time\nYou can't divide My woman's here\nMy children too\nTheir graves are safe\nFrom ghosts like you In places deep\nWith roots entwined\nI live the life I left behind The war was lost\nThe treaty signed\nI was not caught\nI crossed the line I was not caught\nThough many tried\nI live among you\nWell disguised It's coming through a hole in the air\nFrom those nights in Tiananmen Square\nIt's coming from the feel\nThat this ain't exactly real\nOr it's real, but it ain't exactly there\nFrom the wars against disorder\nFrom the sirens night and day\nFrom the fires of the homeless\nFrom the ashes of the gay\nDemocracy is coming to the USA\nIt's coming through a crack in the wall\nOn a visionary flood of alcohol\nFrom the staggering account\nOf the Sermon on the Mount\nWhich I don't pretend to understand at all\nIt's coming from the silence\nOn the dock of the bay,\nFrom the brave, the bold, the battered\nHeart of Chevrolet\nDemocracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the sorrow in the street\nThe holy places where the races meet\nFrom the homicidal bitchin'\nThat goes down in every kitchen\nTo determine who will serve and who will eat\nFrom the wells of disappointment\nWhere the women kneel to pray\nFor the grace of God in the desert here\nAnd the desert far away:\nDemocracy is coming to the USA Sail on, sail on\nOh mighty ship of State\nTo the shores of need\nPast the reefs of greed\nThrough the Squalls of hate\nSail on, sail on, sail on, sail on It's coming to America first\nThe cradle of the best and of the worst\nIt's here they got the range\nAnd the machinery for change\nAnd it's here they got the spiritual thirst\nIt's here the family's broken\nAnd it's here the lonely say\nThat the heart has got to open\nIn a fundamental way\nDemocracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the women and the men\nOh baby, we'll be making love again\nWe'll be going down so deep\nThe river's going to weep,\nAnd the mountain's going to shout Amen\nIt's coming like the tidal flood\nBeneath the lunar sway\nImperial, mysterious\nIn amorous array\nDemocracy is coming to the USA Sail on, sail on\nO mighty ship of State\nTo the shores of need\nPast the reefs of greed\nThrough the squalls of hate\nSail on, sail on, sail on, sail on I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean\nI love the country but I can't stand the scene\nAnd I'm neither left or right\nI'm just staying home tonight\nGetting lost in that hopeless little screen\nBut I'm stubborn as those garbage bags\nAs time cannot decay\nI'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet\nDemocracy is coming to the USA\nTo the USA Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie\n\u00c0 la

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,\nYou know I've watched you riding every day\nAnd something in me yearns to win\nSuch a cold and lonesome heroine.\nAnd who are you? she sternly spoke\nTo the one beneath the smoke.\nWhy, I'm fire, he replied,\nAnd I love your solitude, I love your pride. Then fire, make your body cold,\nI'm going to give you mine to hold,\nSaying this she climbed inside\nTo be his one, to be his only bride.\nAnd deep into his fiery heart\nHe took the dust of joan of arc,\nAnd high above the wedding guests\nHe hung the ashes of her wedding dress. It was deep into his fiery heart\nHe took the dust of joan of arc,\nAnd then she clearly understood\nIf he was fire, oh then she must be wood.\nI saw her wince, I saw her cry,\nI saw the glory in her eye.\nMyself I long for love and light,\nBut must it come so cruel, and oh so bright? Did I ever love you\nDid I ever need you\nDid I ever fight you\nDid I ever want to Did I ever leave you\nWas I ever able\nOr are we still leaning\nAcross the old table Was it ever settled\nWas it ever over\nAnd is it still raining\nBack in November The lemon trees blossom\nThe almond trees whither\nWas I ever someone\nWho could love you forever Did I ever love you\nDoes it really matter\nDid I ever fight you\nYou don't need to answer Did I ever leave you\nWas I ever able\nAnd are we still leaning\nAcross the old table Getting sick of starting over\nOn the same\nArgument\nWe could sit around and talk it over\nOr take a trip\nTo clear our minds\nAt the entrance of Mount Wilson\nIt's feeling like the right decision\nSome times you go outside\nTo get inside\nIf I could only hear you say\nThat you are down but you're ok\nWe should have said the things we felt\nIs it too late\nPark the car and hit the trail\nThe air feels sharp\nOn our skin\nWe'll see the snow as it is melting\nSpring must be on\nHer way again\nWe didn't see her coming for us\nI guess that's mother nature's way\nSometimes you go outside\nTo get inside\nIf I could only hear you say\nThat you are down but you're ok\nWe should have said the things we felt\nIs it too late\nTrapped beneath the wall of snow\nYou're only ten\nFeet away\nSilence has a way of speaking\nOnly now\nDo we understand\nIf I could only hear you say\nThat you are down but you're ok\nWe should have said the things we felt\nIs it too late I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,\nBut the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free\nThen I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe\nAnd then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit\nThen he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it\nThen he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon\nAnd I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school\nHe taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule\nAnd just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool\nHis body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you\nThe poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue\nI suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes\nAnd I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice\nOh please let me come into the storm Sometimes I find I get to\nThinking of the past\nWe swore to each other then\nOur love would surely last You kept right on loving\nI went on a fast\nNow I am too thin\nAnd your love is too vast But I know from your eyes\nAnd I know from your smile\nThat tonight will be fine\nWill be fine, will be fine, will be fine\nFor a while I choose the rooms that I live in with care\nThe windows are small and the walls almost bare\nThere's only one bed and there's only one prayer\nI listen all night for your step on the stair But I know from your eyes\nAnd I know from your smile\nThat tonight will be fine\nWill be fine, will be fine, will be fine\nFor a while Oh, sometimes I see her undressing for me\nShe's the soft naked lady love meant her to be\nAnd she's moving her body so brave and so free\nIf I've got to remember that's a fine memory And I know from her eyes\nAnd I know from her smile\nThat tonight will be fine\nWill be fine, will be fine, will be fine\nFor a while And I know\nAnd I know\nAnd I know Suddenly the night has grown colder\nThe god of love preparing to depart\nAlexandra hoisted on his shoulder,\nThey slip between the sentries of the heart Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure\nThey gain the light, they formlessly entwine\nAnd radiant beyond your widest measure\nThey fall among the voices and the wine It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving\nA fitful dream, the morning will exhaust\nSay goodbye to Alexandra leaving\nThen say goodbye to Alexandra lost Even though she sleeps upon your satin\nEven though she wakes you with a kiss\nDo not say the moment was imagined\nDo not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for this to happen\nGo firmly to the window, drink it in\nExquisite music Alexandra laughing\nYour first commitments tangible again And you who had the honor of her evening,\nAnd by the honor had your own restored\nSay goodbye to Alexandra leaving\nAlexandra leaving with her Lord Even though she sleeps upon your satin\nEven though she wakes you with a kiss\nDo not say the moment was imagined\nDo not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for the occasion\nIn full command of every plan you wrecked\nDo not choose a coward's explanation\nthat hides behind the cause and the effect And you who were bewildered by a meaning\nWhose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed\nSay goodbye to Alexandra leaving\nThen say goodbye to Alexandra lost Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving\nThen say goodbye to Alexandra lost It`s going to happen very soon.\nThe great event which will end the horror.\nWhich will end the sorrow.\nNext Tuesday, when the sun goes down,\nI will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards. This will reverse the effects of the world`s mad plunge into suffering,\nFor the last 200 million years.\nWhat a lovely night that would be.\nWhat a sigh of relief, as the senile robins become bright red again, And the retired nightingales,\nPick up their dusty tails,\nAnd assert the majesty of creation! Maybe I'm still hurting\nI can't turn the other cheek\nBut you know that I still love you\nIt's just that I can't speak\nI looked for you in everyone\nAnd they called me on that too\nI lived alone but I was only\nComing back to you Ah they're shutting down the factory now\nJust when all the bills are due\nAnd the fields they're under lock and key\nTho' the rain and the sun come through\nAnd springtime starts but then it stops\nIn the name of something new\nAnd all the senses rise against this\nComing back to you And they're handing down my sentence now\nAnd I know what I must do\nAnother mile of silence while I'm\nComing back to you There are many in your life\nAnd many still to be\nSince you are a shining light\nThere's many that you'll see\nBut I have to deal with envy\nWhen you choose the precious few\nWho've left their pride on the other side of\nComing back to you Even in your arms I know\nI'll never get it right\nEven when you bend to give me\nComfort in the night\nI've got to have your word on this\nOr none of it is true\nAnd all I've said was just instead of\nComing back to you I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,\nYou were talking so brave and so sweet,\nGiving me head on the unmade bed,\nWhile the limousines wait in the street.\nThose were the reasons and that was New York,\nWe were running for the money and the flesh.\nAnd that was called love for the workers in song\nProbably still is for those of them left. Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,\nYou just turned your back on the crowd,\nYou got away, I never once heard you say,\nI need you, I don't need you,\nI need you, I don't need you\nAnd all of that jiving around. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel\nYou were famous, your heart was a legend.\nYou told me again you preferred handsome men\nBut for me you would make an exception.\nAnd clenching your fist for the ones like us\nWho are oppressed by the figures of beauty,\nYou fixed yourself, you said, \"Well never mind,\nWe are ugly but we have the music.\" And then you got away, didn't you babe\nI don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,\nI can't keep track of each fallen robin.\nI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,\nThat's all, I don't even think of you that often. I've seen you change the water into wine\nI've seen you change it back to water too\nI sit at your table every night\nI try but I just don't get high with you I wish there was a treaty we could sign\nI do not care who takes this bloody hill\nI'm angry and I'm tired all the time\nI wish there was a treaty\nI wish there was a treaty\nBetween your love and mine They're dancing in the street, it's Jubilee\nWe sold ourselves for love but now we're free\nI'm sorry for the ghost I made you be\nOnly one of us was real and that was me I haven't said a word since you've been gone\nThat any liar couldn't say as well\nI just can't believe the static coming on\nYou were my ground, my safe and sound\nYou were my aerial The fields are crying out, it's Jubilee\nWe sold ourselves for love but now we're free\nI'm sorry for the ghost I made you be\nOnly one of us was real and that was me I heard the snake was baffled by his sin\nHe shed his scales to find the snake within\nBut born again is born without a skin\nThe poison enters into everything And I wish there was a treaty we could sign\nI do not care who takes this bloody hill\nI'm angry and I'm tired all the time\nI wish there was a treaty\nI wish there was a treaty\nBetween your love and mine I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz\nWhen an old friend I happened to see\nI introduced him/her to my loved one and while they were dancin'\nMy friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz\nNow I know just how much I have lost\nYes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing\nThe beautiful Tennessee Waltz I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz\nWhen an old friend I happened to see\nI introduced him/her to my loved one and while they were dancin'\nMy friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz\nNow I know just how much I have lost\nYes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing\nThe beautiful Tennessee Waltz Wasn't hard to love you\nDidn't have to try\nWasn't hard to love you\nDidn't have to try\nHeld you for a little while\nMy Oh My Oh My Drove you to the station\nNever asked you why\nDrove you to the station\nNever asked you why\nHeld you for a little while\nMy Oh My Oh My All the boys are waving\nTrying to catch your eye\nAll the boys are waving\nTrying to catch your eye\nHeld you for a little while\nMy Oh My Oh My Wasn't hard to love you\nDidn't have to try\nWasn't hard to love you\nDidn't have to try\nHeld you for a little while\nMy Oh My Oh My I tried to leave you, I don't deny\nI closed the book on us, at least a hundred times\nI'd wake up every morning by your side The years go by, you lose your pride\nThe baby's crying, so you do not go outside\nAnd all your work it's right before your eyes Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied\nThe bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide\nAnd here's a man still working for your smile If the sun would lose its light\nAnd we lived an endless night\nAnd there was nothing left\nThat you could feel\nThat's how it would be\nMy life would seem to me\nIf I didn't have your love\nTo make it real If the stars were all unpinned\nAnd a cold and bitter wind\nSwallowed up the world\nWithout a trace\nOh well that's where I would be\nWhat my life would seem to me\nIf I couldn't lift the veil\nAnd see your face And if no leaves were on the tree\nAnd no water in the sea\nAnd the break of day\nHad nothing to reveal\nThat's how broken I would be\nWhat my life would seem to me\nIf I didn't have your love\nTo make it real If the sun would lose its light\nAnd we lived an endless night\nAnd there was nothing left\nThat you could feel\nIf the sea were sand alone\nAnd the flowers made of stone\nAnd no one that you hurt\nCould ever heal\nWell that's how broken I would be\nWhat my life would seem to me\nIf I didn't have your love\nTo make it real The door it opened slowly\nMy father he came in\nI was nine years old\nAnd he stood so tall above me\nHis blue eyes they were shining\nAnd his voice was very cold He said, \"I've had a vision\nAnd you know I'm strong and holy\nI must do what I've been told\"\nSo he started up the mountain\nI was running, he was walking\nAnd his axe was made of gold Well, the trees they got much smaller\nThe lake, a lady's mirror\nWe stopped to drink some wine\nThen he threw the bottle over\nBroke a minute later\nAnd he put his hand on mine Thought I saw an eagle\nBut it might have been a vulture\nI never could decide\nThen my father built an altar\nHe looked once behind his shoulder\nHe knew I would not hide You who build these altars now\nTo sacrifice these children\nYou must not do it anymore\nA scheme is not a vision\nAnd you never have been tempted\nBy a demon or a God You who stand above them now\nYour hatchets blunt and bloody\nYou were not there before\nWhen I lay upon a mountain\nAnd my father's hand was trembling\nWith the beauty of the word And if you call me brother now\nForgive me if I inquire\n\"Just according to whose plan?\"\nWhen it all comes down to dust\nI will kill you if I must\nI will help you if I can When it all comes down to dust\nI will help you if I must\nI will kill you if I can\nAnd mercy on our uniform\nMan of peace or man of war\nThe peacock spreads his fan I'm traveling light\nIt's au revoir\nMy once so bright\nMy fallen star I'm running late\nThey'll close the bar\nI used to play\nOne mean guitar I guess I'm just\nSomebody who\nHas given up\nOn the me and you\nI'm not alone\nI've met a few\nTraveling light like\nWe used to do Goodnight goodnight\nMy fallen star\nI guess you're right\nYou always are I know you're right\nAbout the blues\nYou live some life\nYou'd never choose I'm just a fool\nA dreamer who\nForgot to dream\nOf the me and you\nI'm not alone\nI've met a few\nTraveling light like\nWe used to do Traveling light\nIt's au revoir\nMy once so bright\nMy fallen star I'm running late\nThey'll close the bar\nI used to play\nOne mean guitar I guess I'm just\nSomebody who\nHas given up\nOn the me and you\nI'm not alone\nI've met a few\nTraveling light like\nWe used to do But if the road\nLeads back to you\nMust I forget\nThe things I knew\nWhen I was friends\nWith one or two\nTraveling light like\nWe used to do\nI'm traveling light Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel\nI pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel\nI walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl\nI said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will\nSo won't you let me see\nI said \"won't you let me see\"\nI said \"won't you let me see\nYour naked body?\" Just dance me to the dark side of the gym\nChances are I'll let you do most anything\nI know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice\nAnd there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice\nAh but no you cannot see\nShe said \"no you cannot see\"\nShe said \"no you cannot see\nMy naked body\" So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust\nBalloons and paper streamers floating down on us\nShe says, You've got a minute left to fall in love\nIn solemn moments such as this I have put my trust\nAnd all my faith to see\nI said all my faith to see\nI said all my faith to see\nHer naked body [Dedicated to Irving Layton] So we'll go no more a-roving\nSo late into the night,\nThough the heart be still as loving,\nAnd the moon be still as bright.\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\nAnd the soul outwears the breast,\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\nAnd love itself have rest.\nThough the night was made for loving,\nAnd the day returns too soon,\nYet we'll go no more a-roving\nBy the light of the moon. By the rivers dark\nI wandered on.\nI lived my life\nIn Babylon. And I did forget\nMy holy song\nAnd I had no strength\nIn Babylon. By the rivers dark\nWhere I could not see\nWho was waiting there\nWho was hunting me. And he cut my lip\nAnd he cut my heart.\nSo I could not drink\nFrom the river dark. And he covered me,\nAnd I saw within,\nMy lawless heart\nAnd my wedding ring, I did not know\nAnd I could not see\nWho was waiting there,\nWho was hunting me. By the rivers dark\nI panicked on.\nI belonged at last\nTo Babylon. Then he struck my heart\nWith a deadly force,\nAnd he said, \u00e2??This heart\nIt is not yours.' And he gave the wind\nMy wedding ring\nAnd he circled us\nWith everything. By the rivers dark,\nIn a wounded dawn,\nI live my life\nIn Babylon. Though I take my song\nFrom a withered limb,\nBoth song and tree,\nThey sing for him. Be the truth unsaid\nAnd the blessing gone,\nIf I forget\nMy Babylon. I did not know\nAnd I could not see\nWho was waiting there,\nWho was hunting me. By the rivers dark,\nWhere it all goes on\nBy the rivers dark\nIn Babylon. Trav'ling lady, stay awhile\nUntil the night is over.\nI'm just a station on your way,\nI know I'm not your lover.\nWell I lived with a child of snow\nWhen I was a soldier,\nAnd I fought every man for her\nUntil the nights grew colder. She used to wear her hair like you\nExcept when she was sleeping,\nAnd then she'd weave it on a loom\nOf smoke and gold and breathing. And why are you so quiet now\nStanding there in the doorway?\nYou chose your journey long before\nYou came upon this highway. Traveling lady stay awhile\nUntil the night is over.\nI'm just a station on your way,\nI know I'm not your lover.
