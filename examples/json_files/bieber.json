another day\nThe meaning of forgiveness\nPeople make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in\nLife is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope\nAvalanche comin' down slow\nDo we have enough time to salvage this love?\nFeels like a blizzard in April\n'Cause my heart is just that cold\nSkating on thin ice\nBut it's strong enough to hold us up\nSeen her scream and holler\nPut us both on blast\nTearing each other down\nWhen I thought it was over\nGod sent us an angel to help us out\nHe gave us direction, showed us how to make it last\nFor that long journey ahead\nSaid it ain't ever over\nOh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living\nLife is worth living, so live another day\nThe meaning of forgiveness\nPeople make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in\nLife is worth living again\nLife is worth living again What I'd give for my affection\nIs a different perception\nFrom what the world may see\nThey try to crucify me\nI ain't perfect, won't deny\nMy reputation's on the line\nSo I'm working on a better me Life is worth living\nLife is worth living, so live another day\nThe meaning of forgiveness\nPeople make mistakes\nOnly God can judge me\nLife is worth living
