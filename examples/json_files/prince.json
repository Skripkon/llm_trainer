dancing close and slow\nI'm not afraid to let my feelings show\nI want to come inside of you\nI want to hold you when we're through\nCan't you feel my love touching you?\n\n\nI've held your hand so many times\nBut I still get the feeling I felt the very first time\nI've kissed your lips and laid with you\nAnd I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms\nI guess my eyes can only see as far as you\nI only want to be with you\n\nWe've come so far in so little time\nSometimes I wonder if this is meant to be\nSometimes you are so very kind\nThat the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave\n\nI guess you could say that I'm just being a fool\nBut I only want to be with you\n\nI guess you could say that I'm just being a fool\nBut I always, always want to be with you\n\n\nI knew from the start\nThat I loved you with all my heart\nBut you were untrue.\nYou had another lover and she looked just like you\nBambi, can't you understand?\nBambi, it's better with a man\n\nIt's so hard to believe\nMaybe it's because you're so young\nOr maybe I'm just too naive\nWho's to say, maybe you're really having fun\n\nBambi, can't you understand?\nBambi, it's better with a man\n\nAll your lovers - they look just like you\nBut they can only do the things that you do\nCome on, baby, and take me by the hand\nI'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man\n\nBambi, I know what you need\nBambi, maybe you need to bleed\n\nYeah!\n\n\nAll my friends tell me\nAbout the loves they've had\nCan't they see what they're doing to me?\nIt makes me feel so bad\n'Cause I'm so alone\nAnd brokenhearted\nIt ain't like my life is ended\nBut more like it never started\nThe love my friends rap about I keep anticipating\nI try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away\nStill waiting\nI'm waiting for that love\nStill waiting\nI wish on every star above\nStill waiting\nWaiting for the love to come around\nOh, love.\nWaiting for the love to come around\n\nPeople say that I'm too young\nToo young to fall in love\nBut they don't know, they really don't know\nThat's all that I've been dreaming of\n'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying\nAnd I spend my days just a-trying\nTo find that love to call my own\n'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone\n\nStill waiting\nWaiting for that love\nStill waiting\nI wish on every star above\nStill waiting\nI'm waiting for the love to come around.\n(Waiting for the love) Don't you know that I'm waiting\n(Waiting for the love) Say..\n(Waiting for the love) To come around now\n\nI need somebody to hold on to baby\nWaiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm\n\nStill waiting\nI'm waiting for the love, sugar\nStill waiting\nIf you're out there girl, please come to me\nStill waiting\nDon't make me cry no more\nStill waiting\nIf you're out there, baby, please come to me\nStill waiting\nWishing and wishing for days, baby\nStill waiting\nIf you're out there, girl, please come to me\nStill waiting\n\n\nBaby, baby, when I look at you\nI get a warm feeling inside\nThere's something about the things you do\nThat keeps me satisfied\nI wouldn't lie to you, baby\nIt's mainly a physical thing\nThis feeling that I got for you, baby\nIt makes me wanna sing\nI feel for you - I think I love you\nI feel for you - I think I love you\n\nBaby, baby, when I lay wit' you\nThere's no place I'd rather be\nI can't believe, can't believe it's true\nThe things that you do to me\nI wouldn't lie to you, baby\nI'm physically attracted to you\nThis feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)\nThere's nothing that I wouldn't

take forever to get you off my mind\nIf ever you decide to go\nI guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you\nI guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave\nI'd be in a messed-up state of blue\nAnd I'd be so lonely\n\nWithout you loving me\nI know it's gonna be lonely\nWithout you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely\n\nWhatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on\n'til I go right out of my mind\nAnd who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree\nIt gets me every time\nI betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star\nThe only bummer is that
