with you still the night is young\nWe keep goin', we go, we go, we go\nWe wake back up and do it all again\n(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end\nI know it's sudden, look at what we've become\nI just want you to know that I did it all for you I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence\nHis sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him\nWhy didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?\n'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same\nEven though they know, that I love him\nFamily ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me\nAnd that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me\nI pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me All things go, all things go\nAll things go, all things go I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone\nWhile we keep waiting for a moment till it falls\nSo can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong\n'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night

just want you to know that I did it all for you Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business\nI'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas\nRock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me\nEven the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness\nI'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact\nI'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that\nShe never understands, why I'm so overprotective\nThe more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected\nI want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say \"We did it!\"\nMy child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute\nSo in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them\nIt's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him\nAnd I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him\nAnd I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him\nJee we did it, let's leave this imprint\nJust finished writing, this is the Pinkprint All things
