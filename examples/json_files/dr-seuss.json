[{"text": "The Cat in the Hat\nBy Dr. Seuss\nThe sun did not shine.\nIt was too wet to play.\nSo we sat in the house\nAll that cold cold wet day.\nI sat there with Sally.\nWe sat there we two.\nAnd I said How I wish\nWe had something to do!\nToo wet to go out\nAnd too cold to play ball.\nSo we sat in the house.\nWe did nothing at all.\nSo all we could do was to\nSit!\nSit!\nSit!\nSit!\nAnd we did not like it.\nNot one little bit.\nBUMP!\nAnd then\nsomething went BUMP!\nHow that bump made us jump!\nWe looked!\nThen we saw him step in on the mat!\nWe looked!\nAnd we saw him!\nThe Cat in the Hat!\nAnd he said to us\nWhy do you sit there like that?\nI know it is wet\nAnd the sun is not sunny.\nBut we can have\nLots of good fun that is funny!\nI know some good games we could play\nSaid the cat.\nI know some new tricks\nSaid the Cat in the Hat.\nA lot of good tricks.\nI will show them to you.\nYour mother\nWill not mind at all if I do.\nThen Sally and I\nDid not know what to say.\nOur mother was out of the house\nFor the day.\nBut our fish said No! No!\nMake that cat go away!\nTell that Cat in the Hat\nYou do NOT want to play.\nHe should not be here.\nHe should not be about.\nHe should not be here\nWhen your mother is out!\nNow! Now! Have no fear.\nHave no fear! said the cat.\nMy tricks are not bad\nSaid the Cat in the Hat.\nWhy we can have\nLots of good fun if you wish\nwith a game that I call\nUP UP UP with a fish!\nPut me down! said the fish.\nThis is no fun at all!\nPut me down! said the fish.\nI do NOT wish to fall!\nHave no fear! said the cat.\nI will not let you fall.\nI will hold you up high\nAs I stand on a ball.\nWith a book on one hand!\nAnd a cup on my hat!\nBut that is not ALL I can do!\nSaid the cat\nLook at me!\nLook at me now! said the cat.\nWith a cup and a cake\nOn the top of my hat!\nI can hold up TWO books!\nI can hold up the fish!\nAnd a litte toy ship!\nAnd some milk on a dish!\nAnd look!\nI can hop up and down on the ball!\nBut that is not all!\nOh no.\nThat is not all\nLook at me!\nLook at me!\nLook at me NOW!\nIt is fun to have fun\nBut you have to know how.\nI can hold up the cup\nAnd the milk and the cake!\nI can hold up these books!\nAnd the fish on a rake!\nI can hold the toy ship\nAnd a little toy man!\nAnd look! With my tail\nI can hold a red fan!\nI can fan with the fan\nAs I hop on the ball!\nBut that is not all.\nOh no.\nThat is not all.\nThat is what the cat said\nThen he fell on his head!\nHe came down with a bump\nFrom up there on the ball.\nAnd Sally and I\nWe saw ALL the things fall!\nAnd our fish came down too.\nHe fell into a pot!\nHe said Do I like this?\nOh no! I do not.\nThis is not a good game\nSaid our fish as he lit.\nNo I do not like it\nNot one little bit!\nNow look what you did!\nSaid the fish to the cat.\nNow look at this house!\nLook at this! Look at that!\nYou sank our toy ship\nSank it deep in the cake.\nYou shook up our house\nAnd you bent our new rake.\nYou SHOULD NOT be here\nWhen our mother is not.\nYou get out of this house!\nSaid the fish in the pot.\nBut I like to be here.\nOh I like it a lot!\nSaid the Cat in the Hat\nTo the fish in the pot.\nI will NOT go away.\nI do NOT wish to go!\nAnd so said the Cat in the Hat\nSo\nso\nso\nI will show you\nAnother good game that I know!\nAnd then he ran out.\nAnd then fast as a fox\nThe Cat in the Hat\nCame back in with a box.\nA big red wood box.\nIt was shut with a hook.\nNow look at this trick\nSaid the cat.\nTake a look!\nThen he got up on top\nWith a tip of his hat.\nI call this game FUN IN A BOX\nSaid the cat.\nIn this box are two things\nI will show to you now.\nYou will like these two things\nSaid the cat with a bow.\nI will pick up the hook.\nYou will see something new.\nTwo things. And I call them\nThing One and Thing Two.\nThese Things will not bite you.\nThey want to have fun.\nThen out of the box\nCame Thing Two and Thing One!\nAnd they ran to us fast.\nThey said How do you do?\nWould you like to shake hands\nWith Thing One and Thing Two?\nAnd Sally and I\nDid not know what to do.\nSo we had to shake hands\nWith Thing One and Thing Two.\nWe shook their two hands.\nBut our fish said No! No!\nThose Things should not be\nIn this house! Make them go!\nThey should not be here\nWhen your mother is not!\nPut them out! Put them out!\nSaid the fish in the pot.\nHave no fear little fish\nSaid the Cat in the Hat.\nThese Things are good Things.\nAnd he gave them a pat.\nThey are tame. Oh so tame!\nThey have come here to play.\nThey will give you some fun\nOn this wet wet wet day.\nNow here is a game that they like\nSaid the cat.\nThey like to fly kites\nSaid the Cat in the Hat\nNo! Not in the house!\nSaid the fish in the pot.\nThey should not fly kites\nIn a house! They should not.\nOh the things they will bump!\nOh the things they will hit!\nOh I do not like it!\nNot one little bit! Then Sally and I\nSaw them run down the hall.\nWe saw those two Things\nBump their kites on the wall!\nBump! Thump! Thump! Bump!\nDown the wall in the hall.\nThing Two and Thing One!\nThey ran up! They ran down!\nOn the string of one kite\nWe saw Mothers new gown!\nHer gown with the dots\nThat are pink white and red.\nThen we saw one kite bump\nOn the head of her bed!\nThen those Things ran about\nWith big bumps jumps and kicks\nAnd with hops and big thumps\nAnd all kinds of bad tricks.\nAnd I said\nI do NOT like the way that they play\nIf Mother could see this\nOh what would she say!\nThen our fish said Look! Look!\nAnd our fish shook with fear.\nYour mother is on her way home!\nDo you hear?\nOh what will she do to us?\nWhat will she say?\nOh she will not like it\nTo find us this way!\nSo DO something! Fast! said the fish.\nDo you hear!\nI saw her. Your mother!\nYour mother is near!\nSo as fast as you can\nThink of something to do!\nYou will have to get rid of\nThing One and Thing Two!\nSo as fast as I could\nI went after my net.\nAnd I said With my net\nI can get them I bet.\nI bet with my net\nI can get those Things yet!\nThen I let down my net.\nIt came down with a PLOP!\nAnd I had them! At last!\nThoe two Things had to stop.\nThen I said to the cat\nNow you do as I say.\nYou pack up those Things\nAnd you take them away!\nOh dear! said the cat\nYou did not like our game\nOh dear.\nWhat a shame!\nWhat a shame!\nWhat a shame!\nThen he shut up the Things\nIn the box with the hook.\nAnd the cat went away\nWith a sad kind of look.\nThat is good said the fish.\nHe has gone away. Yes.\nBut your mother will come.\nShe will find this big mess!\nAnd this mess is so big\nAnd so deep and so tall\nWe ca not pick it up.\nThere is no way at all!\nAnd THEN!\nWho was back in the house?\nWhy the cat!\nHave no fear of this mess\nSaid the Cat in the Hat.\nI always pick up all my playthings\nAnd so\nI will show you another\nGood trick that I know!\nThen we saw him pick up\nAll the things that were down.\nHe picked up the cake\nAnd the rake and the gown\nAnd the milk and the strings\nAnd the books and the dish\nAnd the fan and the cup\nAnd the ship and the fish.\nAnd he put them away.\nThen he said That is that.\nAnd then he was gone\nWith a tip of his hat.\nThen our mother came in\nAnd she said to us two\nDid you have any fun?\nTell me. What did you do?\nAnd Sally and I did not know\nWhat to say.\nShould we tell her\nThe things that went on there that day?\nShould we tell her about it?\nNow what SHOULD we do?\nWell\nWhat would YOU do\nIf your mother asked YOU?\nFox in Socks by Dr. Seuss\nFox\nSocks\nBox\nKnox\nKnox in box.\nFox in socks.\nKnox on fox in socks in box.\nSocks on Knox and Knox in box.\nFox in socks on box on Knox.\nChicks with bricks come.\nChicks with blocks come.\nChicks with bricks and blocks and clocks come.\nLook sir.

The whole Christmas season!\nNow please dont ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\nIt could be his head wasnt screwed on just right.\nIt could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.\nBut I think that the most likely reason of all\nMay have been that his heart was two sizes too small.\nWhatever the reason His heart or his shoes\nHe stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos\nStaring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown\nAt the warm lighted windows below in their town.\nFor he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath\nWas busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath.\nAnd theyre hanging their stockings! he snarled with a sneer\nTomorrow is Christmas! Its practically here!\nThen he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming\nI MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!\nFor Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys\nWould wake bright and early. Theyd rush for their toys!\nAnd then! Oh the noise! Oh the Noise!\nNoise! Noise! Noise!\nThats one thing he hated! The NOISE!\nNOISE! NOISE! NOISE!\nThen the Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.\nAnd theyd feast! And theyd feast! And theyd FEAST!\nFEAST! FEAST! FEAST!\nThey would feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast.\nWhich was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least!\nAnd THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all!\nEvery Who down in Whoville the tall and the small\nWould stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.\nTheyd stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing!\nTheyd sing! And theyd sing! And theyd SING!\nSING! SING! SING!\nAnd the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing\nThe more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing!\nWhy for fifty three years Ive put up with it now!\nI MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?\nThen he got an idea! An awful idea!\nTHE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA!\nI know just what to do! The Grinch laughed in his throat.\nAnd he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.\nAnd he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick!\nWith this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick!\nAll I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around.\nBut since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found.\nDid that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said\nIf I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead!\nSo he called his dog Max. Then he took some red thread\nAnd he tied a big horn on the top of his head.\nTHEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks\nOn a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.\nThen the Grinch said Giddap! And the sleigh started down\nToward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.\nAll their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.\nAll the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.\nWhen he came to the first little house on the square.\nThis is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed\nAnd he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist.\nThen he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.\nBut if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch.\nHe got stuck only once for a moment or two.\nThen he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.\nWhere the little Who stockings all hung in a row.\nThese stockings he grinned are the first things to go!\nThen he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant\nAround the whole room and he took every present!\nPop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!\nCheckerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!\nAnd he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch very nimbly\nStuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney!\nThen he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos feast!\nHe took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast!\nHe cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.\nWhy that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash!\nThen he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.\nAnd NOW! grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree!\nAnd the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove\nWhen he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.\nHe turned around fast and he saw a small Who!\nLittle Cindy Lou Who who was not more than two.\nThe Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter\nWhod got out of bed for a cup of cold water.\nShe stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why????????????\nWhy are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?\nBut you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick\nHe thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!\nWhy my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied\nTheres a light on this tree that wont light on one side.\nSo Im taking it home to my workshop my dear.\nIll fix it up there. Then Ill bring it back here.\nAnd his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head\nAnd he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.\nAnd when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup\nHE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!\nThen the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!\nThen he went up the chimney himself the old liar.\nOn their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.\nAnd the one speck of food That he left in the house\nWas a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.\nThen He did the same thing To the other Whos houses\nLeaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses!\nIt was quarter past dawn All the Whos still a bed\nAll the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled\nPacked it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!\nThe tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!\nThree thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit\nHe rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!\nPoohPooh to the Whos! he was grinchishly humming.\nTheyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming!\nTheyre just waking up! I know just what theyll do!\nTheir mouths will hang open a minute or two\nThen the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!\nThats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear!\nSo he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.\nAnd he did hear a sound rising over the snow.\nIt started in low. Then it started to grow.\nBut the sound wasnt sad! Why this sound sounded merry!\nIt couldnt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!\nHe stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!\nThen he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!\nEvery Who down in Whoville the tall and the small\nWas singing! Without any presents at all!\nHe HADNT stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!\nSomehow or other it came just the same!\nAnd the Grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow\nStood puzzling and puzzling: How could it be so?\nIt came with out ribbons! It came without tags!\nIt came without packages boxes or bags!\nAnd he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore.\nThen the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before!\nMaybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store.\nMaybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more!\nAnd what happened then? Wellin Whoville they say\nThat the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day!\nAnd the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight\nHe whizzed with his load through the bright morning light\nAnd he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!\nAnd he HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!\nUP PUP Pup is up.\nCUP PUP Pup in cup.\nPUP CUP Cup on pup.\nMOUSE HOUSE Mouse on house.\nHOUSE MOUSE House on mouse.\nALL TALL We all are tall.\nALL SMALL We all are small.\nALL BALL We all play ball.\nBALL WALL Up on a wall.\nALL FALL Fall off the wall.\nDAY PLAY We play all day.\nNIGHT FIGHT We fight all night.\nHE ME He is after me.\nHIM JIM Jim is after him.\nSEE BEE We see a bee.\nSEE BEE THREE Now we see three.\nTHREE TREE Three fish in a tree.\nFish in a tree?
