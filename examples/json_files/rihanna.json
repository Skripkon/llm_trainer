On the first page of our story\nThe future seemed so bright\nThen this thing turned out so evil\nI don't know why I'm still surprised\nEven angels have their wicked schemes\nAnd you take that to new extremes\nBut you'll always be my hero\nEven though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices\nGlass is shattered from the fight\nIn this tug of war, you'll always win\nEven when I'm right\n'Cause you feed me fables from your head\nWith violent words and empty threats\nAnd it's sick that all these battles\nAre what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist\nI try to run but I don't want to ever leave\nTil the walls are goin' up\nIn smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face\nSmeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction\nHush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry\nThat you pushed me into the coffee table last night\nSo I can push you off me\nTry and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me\nRun out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy\nBaby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me\nThen tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me\nThen after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the\nDestructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we\nKnow that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs\nThat we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky\nTogether, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,\nYou hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?\nI may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count\nBut together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain\nOur love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling\nThis house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand\nSquare feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it\nWith you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond\nShine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea\nI choose to be happy\nYou and I, you and I\nWe're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see\nA vision of ecstasy\nWhen you hold me, I'm alive\nWe're like diamonds in the sky I knew that we'd become one right away\nOh, right away\nAt first sight I left the

there's gravel in our voices\nGlass is shattered from the fight\nIn this tug of war, you'll always win\nEven when I'm right\n'Cause you feed me fables from your head\nWith violent words and empty threats\nAnd it's sick that all these battles\nAre what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist\nI try to run but I don't want to ever leave\nTil the

sorry\nThat you pushed me into the coffee table last night\nSo I can push you off me\nTry and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me\nRun out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy\nBaby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me\nThen tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me\nThen after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the\nDestructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we\nKnow that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs\nThat we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky\nTogether, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,\nYou hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?\nI may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count\nBut together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain\nOur love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling\nThis house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand\nSquare feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it\nWith you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie Take a breath, take it deep\nCalm yourself, he says to me\nIf you play,
