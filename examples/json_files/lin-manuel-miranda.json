President Thank you, Secretary Jefferson Secretary Hamilton, your response You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think\nThe President is gonna bring the nation to the brink\nOf meddling in the

our treaty, King Louis' head\nUh do whatever you want, I'm super dead Enough, Hamilton is right Mister President We're too fragile to start another fight But sir, do we not fight for freedom Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em The people are leading The people are rioting\nThere's a difference, frankly\nIt's a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality\nHamilton Sir Draft a statement of neutrality Did you forget Lafayette What Have you an ounce of regret\nYou accumulate debt, you accumulate power\nYet in their hour of need, you forget Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine\nAnd before he was your friend, he was mine\nIf we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop\nWhere do we draw the line So quick witted Alas,

that was New York bound I wrote my way out of hell\nI wrote my way to revolution\nI was louder than the crack in the bell\nI wrote Eliza love letters until she fell\nI wrote about The Constitution and defended it well\nAnd in the face of ignorance and resistance\nI wrote financial systems into existence\nAnd when my prayers to God were met with indifference\nI picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance In the eye of a hurricane\nThere is quiet\nFor just a moment\nA yellow sky I was twelve when my mother died\nShe was holding me\nWe were sick and she was holding me\nI couldn't seem to die Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (I'll write my way out)\nWait for it, wait for it, wait for it (write everything down, far as I can see)\nWait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait (history has its eyes on you) I'll write my way out\nOverwhelm them with honesty This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only\nWay I can protect my legacy Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait The Reynolds Pamphlet Mister President, you asked to see me I know you're busy What do you need, sir Sir\nI wanna give you a word of warning Sir, I don't know what you heard\nBut whatever it is, Jefferson started it Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning You're kidding I need a favor Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior Shh, talk less I'll use the press\nI'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him I need you to draft an address Yes, he resigned, you can finally speak your mind No, he's stepping down so he can run for President Ha, good luck defeating

goodbye\nTo say goodbye\nYou and I No, sir, why I wanna talk about neutrality Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time I want to warn against partisan fighting But Pick up a pen, start writing\nI wanna talk about what I have learned\nThe hard won wisdom I have earned As far as the people are concerned\nYou have to serve, you could continue to serve No, one last time\nThe people will hear from me\nOne last time\nAnd if we get this right\nWe're gonna teach 'em how to say\nGoodbye\nYou and I Mister President, they will say you're weak No, they will see we're strong Your position is so unique So I'll use it to move them along Why do you have to say goodbye If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on\nIt outlives me when I'm gone\nLike the scripture says\nEveryone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree\nAnd no one shall make them afraid\nThey'll be safe in the nation we've made\nI wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree\nA moment alone in the shade\nAt home in this nation we've made\nOne last time One last time Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration\nI am unconscious of intentional error\nI am nevertheless too sensible of my defects\nNot to think it probable that I may have committed many errors\nI shall also carry with me The hope\nThat my country will\nView them with indulgence\nAnd that\nAfter forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal\nThe faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion\nAs I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest\nI anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat\nIn which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking\nIn the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of good laws\nUnder a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart\nAnd the happy reward, as I trust\nOf our mutual cares, labors, and dangers One last time George Washington's going home Teach 'em how to say goodbye George Washington's going home You and I George Washington's going home Going home George Washington's going home History has its eyes on you George Washington's going home We're gonna teach 'em how to say

Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir\nThe constitution clearly states\nThat the states have to wait\nUntil eighteen-oh-eight to debate\nOn whether to end the slave trade\nAnd whether or not you want it, guys\nThat is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate\nUnanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great\nWe cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate\nSo back to Africa or do they get a separate state?\nIn 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West\nMy notion didn't get a single vote\nSlavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer\nBut we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good\nPlantation states are packed with promise makers\nDo you realize the precious time these legislators wasted?\nInstitutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles\nWait till the 1800's, and their population doubles\nYou all know\nThis is the stain on our soul and democracy\nA land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy\nTo subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property\nAnd say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee?\nSir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves\nWhose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves\nHow will the south find labor for its businesses?\nHow will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings\nAll your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel\nI don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President?\nMadison?\nLet's take this moment to establish a precedent\nFirst of all, sir, we won't involve you in this\nImagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous\nI'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year\nThat was agreed upon\nThat buys us time and assuages fear\nI'll tell the North that on January 1st\nOf that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst\nOnce I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen\nAnd introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President! Hamilton, if we support emancipation\nEvery single slave owner will demand compensation\nAnd as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses\nDo you really wanna- Do you really wanna have that conversation? No Madison, execute your plan to the letter\nLet's hope the next generation thinks of something better I saved every letter you wrote me\nFrom the moment I read them, I knew you were mine\nYou said you were mine\nI thought you were mine Do you know what Angelica said\nWhen we saw your first letter arrive?\nShe said \"Be careful with that one, love\nHe will do what it takes to survive\" You and your words flooded my senses\nYour sentences left me defenseless\nYou built me palaces out of paragraphs\nYou built cathedrals\nI'm re-reading the letters you wrote me\nI'm searching and scanning for answers in every line\nFor some kind of sign, and when you were mine\nThe world seemed to burn\nBurn You published the letters she wrote you\nYou told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed\nIn clearing your name, you have ruined our lives\nDo you know what Angelica said\nWhen she read what you'd done?\nShe said\n\"You have married an Icarus\nHe has flown too close to the sun\" You and your words, obsessed with your legacy\nYour sentences border on senseless\nAnd you are paranoid in every paragraph\nHow they perceive you You, you, you I'm erasing myself from the narrative\nLet future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart\nYou have torn it all apart, I'm watching it\nBurn\nWatching it burn\nThe world has no right to my heart\nThe world has no place in our bed\nThey don't get to know what I said\nI'm burning the memories\nBurning the letters that might have redeemed you\nYou forfeit all rights to my heart\nYou forfeit the place in our bed\nYou sleep in your office instead\nWith only the memories of when you were mine\nI hope that you burn "}]
