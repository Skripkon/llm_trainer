be some next man's other woman soon\nI cannot play my self again\nI should just be my own best friend\nNot fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day,

the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts\nHe floats me with dread\nSoaked in soul\nHe swims in my eyes by the bed\nPour myself over him\nMoon spilling in\nAnd I wake up alone If I was my heart\nI'd rather be restless\nThe second I stop, the sleep catches up\nAnd I'm breathless\n'Cause this ache in my chest\nAs my day is done now\nThe dark covers me, and I cannot run now\nMy blood running cold\nI stand before him (before him, I)\nIt's all I can do to assure him (assure him)\nWhen he comes to me\nI drip for him tonight\nDrowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts\nHe floats me with dread\nSoaked in soul\nHe swims in my eyes by the bed\nPour myself over him\nMoon spilling in\nAnd I wake up alone\nAnd I wake up alone\nAnd I wake up

Now, how can he have her heart\nWhen it got stole?\nSo he tries to pacify her\n'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth\nShe is plagued with urgency\nSearching kisses\nThe man she misses\nThe man that he longs to be Now, how can he have her heart\nWhen it got stole?\nSo he tries to pacify her\n'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her\n'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her\nBut what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu\nWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue\nTough to sort files with your voice in my head\nSo then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh And now I feel so small discovering you knew\nHow much more torture would you have put me through?\nYou probably saw me laughing at all your jokes\nOr how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah\nYou sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb\nWith your battered jeans and your Beasties tee\nNow I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years\nIt just serves to bludgeon my futile tears\nAnd I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase\nBut now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah\nAnd the melodramas of my day delivery blows\nAnd that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show\nA simple attraction that reflects right back to me\nSo I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed\nYou sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb\nWith your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah\nNow I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind\nMaybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah\nOh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks\nDespite my frustration for the way that he thinks\nAnd I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect\nAt least you're attracted to me which I did not expect\nDidn't think you'd get my number down as such\nBut I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah\nYou sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah\nSo with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee\nNow I can't work like this, no, with you

You left for London, when you were nineteen\nHad to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams\nA man in the bright lights took all that you own\nNow he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun\nYour worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone\nHey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long\nAnd now little rich girl, I wrote this song\nHey, little rich girl my love for you is gone\nAnd now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue\nYou caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you\nYou left for London, when you were nineteen\nHad to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun\nBut your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone\nHey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?\nHey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming\nI don't have a key for downstairs\nSo I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there\nAnd now my head's hurting\nYou say I always get my own way\nBut you were in the shower when I got there\nAnd I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today\nAnd then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas\nPut it in the box, put it in the box\nFrank's in there and I don't care\nPut it in the box, put it in the box\nJust take it\nTake the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be\nI feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me\nFeel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you\nBut when I left my shit in your kitchen\nI said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense\nI just don't know you\nBut you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'\nI think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas\nPut it in the box, put it in the box\nFrank's in there and I don't care\nPut it in the box, put it in the box\nNow take it\nTake the box\nJust take it, take it\nTake the box\nAnd now just take the box\nTake the box Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i\nAlways hear, when you sigh,\nNever in my wordland could there be words to reveal\nIn a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves\nBill and coo, when they love?\nThat's the kind of magic music we made with our lips\nWhen we kiss And there's a weepy old willow\nHe really knows how to cry\nThat's how i'd cry in my pillow\nIf you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low\nKiss me sweet, and we'll go\nFlying high in birdland, high in the sky up above\nAll because we're in love Lullaby, lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves\nBill and coo when they love?\nThat's the kind of magic music we made with our lips\nWhen we kiss And there's a weepy old willow\nHe really knows how to cry\nThat's how i'd cry in my pillow\nIf you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low\nKiss me sweet, and we'll go\nFlying high in birdland, high in the sky up above\nAll because we're in love I should care, I should go around weeping\nI should care, I should go without sleeping\nStrangely enough, I sleep well\n'cept for a dream or two\nBut then I count my sheep well\nFunny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care, I should let it upset me\nI should care but it just doesn't get me\nMaybe I won't find someone as lovely as you\nBut I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me\nMaybe I won't find someone as lovely as you\nBut I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you\nI'd take a thousand thumps for my love\n'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe\nStuck it in my boxing glove\n'Cause anyone who will see us\nThrough our victory and done defeat\nKnows that I'll take you to the cleaners\nIf you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh\nBetween the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler\nAnd he still make this housewife

both\nAnd it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh\nBetween the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh\nBetween the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth\nA beautiful thing taking you away\nMy head is spinning My girl tried to stop me\nBut I had a taste of you\nUnfamiliar surroundings\nLeft me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type\nBut you're one of a

When you walk in the bar,\nAnd you dressed like a star,\nRockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you,\nWith your Gucci bag crew,\nCan't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same,\nEveryone knows your name,\nAnd that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night,\nCause your dream in life,\nIs to be a footballers wife.\nYou don't like players,\nThat's what you say-a,\nBut you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers,\nThey don't do nothing for ya,\nBut you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan,\nLookin' for a man,\nBut you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life,\nIf you got past one night,\nBut that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed,\nHe's onto the next,\nAnd you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset,\nIf they call you a skank,\nCause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players,\nThat's what you say-a,\nBut you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers,\nDon't do nothing for ya.\nBut you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right,\nCause you jeans are too tight,\nAnd your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse,\nEvery week it gets worse,\nAt least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami,\nCause you got there for free,\nBut somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E,\nMet somebody,\nAnd spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you,\nThere'd be no fun,\nWe'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you,\nThere's no nightlife,\nAll those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me,\nCause you're pushing thirty,\nAnd your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job,\nThat you always get dumped,\nSo dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end\nYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you're on your own\nI won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you're on your own\nI won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end\nYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end\nYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved\nYou're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end\nYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar\nHumbled by the bass\nSo when the beat kicks in\nEverything falls into place\nAnd it overpowers me\nI can't help but dance\nYou can try to stop me now\nBut you won't get the chance Half time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change\nSee it from a different view\nHalf time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change Rhythm floods my heart\nThe melody it feeds my soul\nThe tune tears me apart\nAnd it swallows me whole\nYou should thank your lucky stars\n'Cause the music is a gift\nAnd it's stronger than all else\nProvides me with uplift Half time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change\nSee it from a different view\nHalf time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change My lyrics revealing\nSome natural vibe\nSome kind of laid back feeling\nOh, just let it ride\nAnd when Frank Sinatra sings\nIt's too much to take\nSo I sing the standard shit\nIt pacifies my ache Half time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change\nSee it from a different view\nHalf time\nTime to think it through\nConsider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard\nYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt\nYou say, \"Why did you do it with him today?\"\nAnd sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy\nHand me your Stella and fly\nBy the time I'm out the door\nYou tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy\nHe's in the place, but I can't get joy\nThinking of you in the final throes\nThis is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter\nYou say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter\nThere'll be none of him no more\nI cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain\nWe're like how we were again\nI'm in the tub, you're on the seat\nLick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn\nMy stomach drops, and my guts churn\nYou shrug, and it's the worst\nTo truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya I was troubled\nYeah, ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night\nBut I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right\nI pressed his chest under my fingertips\nBeside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical\nFunny don'tcha know\nI just wan get physical\nLet me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear\nDo me good, do me good, do me good, do me good\nDo me good and all this craziness will disappear\nDo me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind\nHe's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined\nI miss him most of all when it got late\nAttempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical\nFunny don'tcha know\nI just wan get physical\nLet me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear\nDo me good, do me good, do me good, do me good\nDo me good and all this craziness will disappear\nDo me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man\nI just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI feel it my heart like you were there\nI never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it's just too hard\nI never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you\nAnd surprisingly you hate me too\nWe only communicate when we need to fight\nBut we are best friends...right?

right,\nWhen we were at our high,\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night,\nI knew I hadn't met my match,\nBut every moment we could snatch,\nI don't know why I got so attached,\nIt's my responsibility,\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me,\nBut to walk away I have no capacity He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd in this grey, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own, I don't understand,\nWhy do I stress a man,\nWhen there's so many better things at hand,\nWe could a never had it all,\nWe had to hit a wall,\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal,\nEven if I stop wanting you,\nA perspective pushes through,\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon, I shouldn't play myself again,\nI should just be my own best friend,\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd it's okay,\nIn this blue shade,\nMy tears dry on their own, So we are history,\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above,\nA blaze He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd it's okay,\nIn this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets,\nAnd no emotional debts,\nAnd as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,\nSo we are history,\nThe shadow covers me,\nThe sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd it's okay,\nIn this blue shade,\nMy tears dry on their own, He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd it's okay,\nMy deep shade,\nMy tears dry on their own He walks away,\nThe sun goes down,\nHe takes the day but I'm grown,\nAnd it's okay,\nMy deep shade,\nMy tears dry She sits home and dreams\nThat her man will leave his mark on her hand\nHe's not all he seems\nBut she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned\nNow she won't be happy\nTill she look down and sees the engagement ring\nIt's for security\nBut she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus]\nFor me it ain't real\nIt's fools gold\nThere too many fools sold\nNot an excuse oh\nFor me it ain't real\nIt's fools gold\nI don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life\nHe just chasing tail\nAnd wasting her time\nShe calls herself his wife\nHe calls her at 8 says be here by 9\nShe don't notice how when she gets the ring\nIt's not a good fit\nSo next time that they row She throws it out\nIt goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find\nAnd for your own sake\nHold it in your hand\nNow make sure you bite down\nAnd watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real\nIt's fools gold\nThere too many fools sold\nNot an excuse oh\nFor me it ain't real\nYes it's fools gold Every day I see you\nMy hands were made for you\nAnd you always give me stress free point of view\nPick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token\nMister Magic, of my love\nMister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery\nBlue without my green\nAll the songs sound better when you're next to me\nYeah, 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token\nMister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)\nI see you through the smoke Laying on my bed\nI reach over for you\nAnd you so fresh you even make the standards new\nBurn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token\nMister Magic, of my love\nMister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic\nMister Magic\nMister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear\nI'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.\nFollow my father, his extravagant ways.\nSo if I got it I will spend it all,\nCamden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine,\nAs I check my balance I kiss the screen.\nI love it when it says I got the means,\nTo go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2)\nNever lasts me long,\nHandle finance wrong,\nBlow it all on bags and shoes,\nJazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today,\nWait with impatience to throw my cash away.\nFour white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.\nBut that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,\nAnd I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.\nTell you what, my advance is comin' through,\nI'll take you out shoppin',\nCan you wait 'til next June? Yeah.
