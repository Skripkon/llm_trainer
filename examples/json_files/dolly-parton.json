From here to the moon and back\nWho else in this world will love you like that?\nLove everlasting, I promise you that\nFrom here to the moon and back\nFrom here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend\nOn promises made and love without end\nNo need to wonder how faithful I'll be\nNow and on into eternity From here to the moon and back\nWho else in this world will love you like that?\nForever and always, I'll be where you're at\nFrom here to the moon and back\nFrom here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat\nI would call out your name to echo through the vast\nThank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat\nFrom here to the moon and back\nAnd I'll spend forever just proving that fact\nFrom here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly\nAs soft and gentle as a sigh\nThe multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings\nLove makes your heart feel strange inside\nIt flutters like soft wings in flight\nLove

love are like it's satin wings\nLove makes your heart feel strange inside\nIt flutters like soft wings in flight\nLove is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Oh, the pain of loving you\nOh, the misery I go through\nNever knowing what to do\nOh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy\nSeems you hurt me all you can\nStill I go on loving you\nBut I never understand To love and hate at the same time\nThe line between the two is fine\nThe two have bound me heart and soul\nSo strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time\nThe line between the two is fine\nThe two have bound me heart and soul\nSo strong that I can't let you go Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown\nI set out to get you with a fine tooth comb\nI was soft inside, there was somethin' going on\nYou do something to me that I can't explain\nHold me closer and I feel no pain\nEvery beat of my heart\nWe got somethin' goin' on\nTender love is blind\nIt requires a dedication\nAll this love we feel\nNeeds no conversation\nWe ride it together, ah-ah\nMakin' love with each other, ah-ah Islands in the stream\nThat is what we are\nNo one in-between\nHow can we be wrong\nSail away with me to another world\nAnd we rely on each other, ah-ah\nFrom one lover to another, ah-ah I can't live without you if the love was gone\nEverything is nothin' if you got no one\nAnd you did walk in tonight\nSlowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt\nToo deep in love and we got no way out\nAnd the message is clear\nThis could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry\nBaby, I will hurt you never\nWe start and end as one, in love forever\nWe can ride it together, ah-ah\nMakin' love with each other, ah-ah\nIslands in the stream\nThat is what we are\nNo one in-between\nHow can we be wrong\nSail away with me to another world\nAnd we rely on each other, ah-ah\nFrom one lover to another, ah-ah Sail away\nOh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream\nThat is what we are\nNo one in-between\nHow can we be wrong\nSail away with me to another world\nAnd we rely on each other, ah-ah\nFrom one lover to another, ah-ah Islands in the stream\nThat is what we are\nNo one in-between\nHow can we be wrong\nSail away with me to another world\nAnd we rely on each other, ah-ah\nFrom one lover to another, ah-ah (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Please, please don't stop loving me\nFor I couldn't live with you gone\nPlease, please don't stop loving me\nFor I couldn't make it alone\nYou bring me the sunshine when none is in sight\nAnd when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light\nYou opened my eyes when I couldn't see\nSo please, oh, please don't stop loving me You're my inspiration, my purpose in life\nWhen things go all wrong, you make them all right\nI would be useless if you ever leave\nSo please, oh please don't stop loving me Please, please don't stop loving me\nFor I couldn't live with you gone\nPlease, please don't stop loving me\nFor I couldn't make it alone\nPlease, please don't stop loving me An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you\nA solid gold mansion, an airplane or two\nThis whole world would be yours to have and to hold\nIf teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold\nI'd have all the riches my pockets would hold\nI'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold\nIf teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing\nThe heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring\nThe love that I wanted would not have grown cold\nIf teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold\nI'd have all the riches my pockets would hold\nI'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold\nIf teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold But teardrops aren't pennies\nAnd heartaches aren't gold (Dolly Parton) Little sparrow, little sparrow\nPrecious fragile little thing\nLittle sparrow, little sparrow\nFlies so high and feels no pain\nAll ye maidens hede my

Tennessee mountain home\nCrickets sing in the fields near by Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane\nTheir fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet\nAnd on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings\nAn' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody In my Tennessee mountain home\nLife is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\nCrickets sing in the fields near by Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love\nJust laughin', talkin', making future plans\nAnd when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two\nSittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands In my Tennessee mountain home\nLife is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\nIn my Tennessee mountain home\nCrickets sing in the fields near by (Dolly Parton/Carl Perkins) When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do\nWhen it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to\nWhen it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you\nAnd they always put you to the test\nAnd you always try to do your best\nAnd just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family Some are preachers, some are gay\nSome are addicts, drunks and strays\nBut not a one is turned away, when it's family\nSome are lucky, others ain't\nSome are fighters, others faint\nWinners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door\nWhen it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for\nWhen it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more\nSomehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way\nTo solve the problems day to day, in the family You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone\nGood or bad or indifferent, it's still family\nYou choose your lovers, you pick your friends\nNot the family that you're in, nah\nThey'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do\nWhen it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you\nWhen it's family, when it's family\nLet me be all that I should be to the family (Dolly Parton) Well a good ways down the railroad track\nThere was this little old rundown shack\nAnd in it lived a man I'd never seen\nFolks said he was a mean and a vicious man\nAnd you better not set foot on his land\nI didn't think nobody could be that mean\nSo I took me out walking down the railroad track\nI was a-gonna go down to that little old shack\nAnd just find out if all them things I'd heard was true\nThere was a big black dog laying out in the yard\nAnd it growled at me and I swallowed hard\nAnd I heard somebody say well who are you\nOh and there he stood in the door of that shack\nHis beard and his hair was long and black\nAnd he was the biggest man I'd ever seen\nWhen he spoke his voice was low and deep\nBut he just didn't frighten me\n'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean\nHe said what you doing snooping 'round my place\nAnd I saw a smile come across his face\nSo I smiled back and I told him who I was\nHe said come on in and pull you up a chair\nYou might as well since you already here\nAnd he said you can call me Joshua\nJoshua Joshua\nWhatcha doing living here all alone\nJoshua Joshua\nAin't you got nobody to call your own\nNo no no no We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight\nAnd we still talking when it come daylight\nAnd there was just so much we had to say hey\nI'd spent my life in an orphan's home\nAnd just like him I was all alone\nSo I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay\nOh we grew closer as time went on\nAnd that little old shack it was a happy home\nAnd we just couldn't help but fall in love\nThat big black dog and that little old shack\nSitting down by the railroad track\nIt's plenty good enough for me and Joshua Joshua Joshua\nWhy you're just what I've been looking for\nJoshua Joshua\nYou ain't gonna be lonesome anymore\nNo no Yodel-a-he-ho Me and Joshua\nMe and Joshua\nMe and Joshua yeah yeah\nMe and Joshua (Dolly Parton) Take my hand and run with me\nOut of the past of yesterday\nAnd walk with me into the future of tomorrow\nYesterday must be forgot\nNo looking back no matter what\nThere's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever No more crying tears leave tracks\nAnd mem'ries find their way back\nTomorrow's waiting

the passing time\nMy love for you is the real kind\nThe kind that won't hurt you, oh never Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever\nYesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top\nDown in the Tennessee hills\nCause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top\nAin't no telephone bill Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top\nHalf bear the other half cat\nWell, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop\nI often think about that Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be\nHome sweet home to me\nGood ol' Rocky Top\nRocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top\nLookin' for a moonshine still\nStrangers ain't come down from Rocky Top\nAnd some say they never will Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?\nThe dirt's too rocky by far\nAnd that's why all the folks on Rocky Top\nGet their corn from a jar Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be\nHome sweet home to me\nGood ol' Rocky Top\nRocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now I've had years of cramped up city life\nTrapped luck a duck in a pen\nAll I know is it's a dad-burn pity\nLife can't be simple again Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be\nHome sweet home to me\nGood ol' Rocky Top\nRocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee\nTennessee, Rocky Top It's a lesson too late for the learning\nMade of sand, made of sand\nIn the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'\nIn your hand, in your hand Are you going away\nWith no word of farewell\nWill there be not a trace left behind\nOh i could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind\nYou know that was the last thing on my mind\nAs we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'\nRound and round, round and round Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'\nUnderground, underground\nAre you going away\nWith no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind\nOh i could've loved you better\nDidn't mean to be unkind\nYou know that was the last thing on my mind I've got reason a plenty for goin\nThis i know, this i know\nThe weeds have been steadily growin'\nPlease don't go, please don't go Are you going away\nWith no word of farewell\nWill there be not a trace left behind\nI could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind\nYou know that was the last thing on my mind\nAre you going away\nWith no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind\nOh i could've loved you better\nDidn't mean to be unkind\nYou know that was the last thing on my mind You know that was the last thing on my mind (Dolly Parton) Daddy was an old time preacher man\nHe preacher the word of God throughout the land\nHe preached so plain a child could understand\nYes, Daddy was an old time preacher man\nHe told the people of he need to pray\nHe talked about God's wrath and judgement day\nHe preached about the great eternity\nHe preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man\nAunt Leanona would get up to testify\nAnd we'd sing \"In The Sweet By And By\"\nThe we'd sing \"I'm On My Way To Canaan Land\"\nYes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks\nFolks came from all around to hear him preach\nDaddy said if one is saved it's worth it all\nBut the aisles were always filled at altar calls\nYes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay\nFor he believed that God provides a way\nWe never had a lot but we got by\nGuess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side\nYes, Daddy was an old time preacher man [Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.\nDon't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.\nSo read into it what you will, but see me as I am.\nThe way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.\nI wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,\nlike Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.\nFrom rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.\nI'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.\nDon't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.\nDon't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that\nI'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.\nI might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.\nYes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.\nBut even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance. All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,\n'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. To know, know, know him\nIs to love love love him\nJust to see him smile\nMakes my life worthwhile\nTo know know know him\nIs to love love love him\nAnd I do I'll be good to him\nI'll bring love to him\nEveryone says there'll come a day\nWhen I'll walk alongside of him\nYes, just to know him\nIs to love love love him\nAnd I do Why can't he see\nHow blind can he be\nSomeday he will see\nThat he was meant for me, ooh To know, know, know him\nIs to love love love him\nJust to see him smile\nMakes my life worthwhile\nTo know, know, know him\nIs to love love love him\nAnd I do When the mornin' sun\nStreaks across my room\nAnd I'm wakin' up\nFrom another dream of you\nYes, you know I'm on the road\nOnce again it seems\nAll that's left behind\nIs a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you\nYou know that I love you\nOh, I love you And how I wish that love\nWas all we'd need to live\nWhat a life we'd have\n'Cause I've got so much to give\nBut ya' know I feel so sad\nDown inside my heart\nThat the dollar sign\nShould be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you\nYou know that I love you\nOh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time\nWhen the problems of this life\nHad not yet crossed my mind\nAnd the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes\nI'd come runnin' back to you\nI'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't\nLive on dreams alone\nGot to pay the rent\nSo I must leave you all alone\n'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago\nAnd now this travelin' life\nWell, it's the only life I know But you know that I

the next teardrop falls Though it hurts to let you go\nDarling I want you to know\nI'll run to you if ever you should call\nAnd if I should ever hear\nThat she's made you shed a tear\nI'll be there before the next teardrop falls I'll be there anytime you need me by your side\nTo dry away each teardrop you've cried\nIf she ever leaves you blue\nJust remember I love you\nAnd I'll be there\nBefore

flew home\nAnd we all gathered here\nIn sorrow and tears\nIt won't be the same with her gone\nThere's a place on the hill\nThat's peaceful and still\nWhere she'll sleep beside daddy again\nThe ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves\nBut we'll all met in heaven again Chorus: Oh, she's an angel\nLet her fly, let her fly\nShe's gone home to glory\nTo her home in the sky\nWhen God sees her

already wrapped around your finger\nOh what's a heart to do\n'Cause it lingers\nAnd the thought of you\nWantin' me as much as I want you [Chorus] Makes me blue\nI'm not holding you tonight\n'Cause

pines, where the sun never shines\nAnd you shiver when the cold wind blows\nMy love, my love, what have I done\nTo make you treat me so\nYou've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn\nYou've caused me to leave my home In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines\nAnd you shiver when the cold wind blows The longest train I ever saw\nWent down that Georgia Line\nThe engine passed at six o'clock\nThe caboose went by at nine In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines\nAnd you shiver when the cold wind blows I asked my captain for the time of day\nHe said he throwed his watch away In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines\nAnd you shiver when the cold wind blows\nHoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo (Dolly Parton) He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack\nHis real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack\nNow old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew\nAppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack\nPlay a song for me and I'll sing\nPlay a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack\nPlay a song, let your banjo ring Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday\nWe'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made\nThen he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing\nAnd he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack\nPlay a song for me and I'll sing\nPlay a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack\nPlay a song, let your banjo ring That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown\nAll I have are memories,

you want me and it's too late\nOnce my love for you was so great\nBut it's too late to love me now It's too bad\nYou say you need me and it's too bad\nI know the feelin' and it's so sad\nBut it's too late to love me now\nIt's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried\nTo hold out just for you?\nLovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life\nTurned my dreams around\nHe's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late\nYou say you want me and it's too late\nOnce my love for you was so great\nBut it's too late to love me now\nIt's too late to love me now

late\nYou say you need me and it's too late\nOnce my love for you was so great\nBut it's too late to love me now\nIt's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl\nSat by an old church door\nThe little girl's feet\nWere as brown as the curl\nThat fell on the dress that she wore\nThe little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn\nThey shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home\nTo you mommy I said\nAnd this was the maddens reply\nMommy's in heaven\nAngels took her away\nLeft Tim and I all alone\nWe've no one to love us\nAnd daddy is dead\nAnd our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick\nAngels took her away\nTo dwell in those mansions so bright\nShe said she would come\nFor her children some day\nAnd I guess she's coming tonight\nThe sexton came early\nTo ring the church bell\nAnd found them\nBeneath the snow white\nThe angels made room for the orphans to dwell\nUp in heaven with their mommy that night (Dolly Parton) She's been there, God knows, she's been there\nShe has seen and done it all\nShe's a woman, she know how to\nDish it out or take it all\nHer heart's as soft as feathers\nStill she weathers stormy skies\nAnd she's a sparrow when she's broken\nBut she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors\nYou can toss her around and round\nYou can keep her in you vision\nBut you'll never keep her down\nShe's a lover, she's a mother\nShe's a friend and she's a wife\nAnd she's a sparrow when she's broken\nBut she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia\nStrong as steel, her faith and pride\nShe's an everlasting shoulder\nShe's the leaning post of life\nShe hurts deep and when she weeps\nShe's just as fragile as a child\nAnd she's a sparrow when she's broken\nBut she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken\nBut she's an eagle when she flies\nOh, bless her, Lord\nShe's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed\nBy the way you look at me\nAnd I'm sorry that I'm not\nThe woman you thought I'd be\nYes, I've made my mistakes\nBut listen and understand\nMy mistakes are no worse than yours\nJust because I'm a woman So when you look at me\nDon't feel sorry for yourself\nJust think of all the shame\nYou might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this\nThen we'll both know where we stand\nMy mistakes are no worse than yours\nJust because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl\nAnd he'll ruin her reputation\nBut when he wants to marry\nWell, that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her\nTo do the best she can\nWhile he looks for an angel\nTo wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel\nIf that's what you thought you'd found\nI was just the victim of\nA man that let me down Yes, I've made my mistakes\nBut listen and understand\nMy mistakes are no worse than yours\nJust because I'm a woman No, my mistakes are no worse than yours\nJust because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry\nOne we made some time ago\nWhen they ask who's in the picture with me\nI say just \"Someone I use to know\" Just someone, I used to spend some time with\nJust a flame, that's lost its glow\nBut I don't them of the nights I cried without you\nI say just \"Someone I use to know\" Just someone, I use to run around with\nJust a friend from long ago\nI don't tell them, how lost I am without you\nI say just \"Someone I use to know\" I say just \"Someone I use to know\" (Dolly Parton) Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy\nShe never wanted to be more than mother and a wife\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life\nWas to make our house a home and make us happy\nMomma never wanted anymore than what she had\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone\nShe didn't mind the stayin' home\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy\nAnd she never missed the flowers\nAnd the gifts he never gave her\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted\nAnd she didn't need those things to make her happy\nShe didn't even seem to notice\nThat he didn't kiss and hold her\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke\nJust to find the note\nThat momma carefully wrote\nAnd left to daddy\nAnd as he began to read it\nOur ears could not believe it\nThe words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough\nAnd they don't need me very much\nSo I've gone in search for love I need so badly\nI have needed you so long\nBut I just can't keep holdin' on\nShe never meant to come back home\nIf she did, she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone\nGood-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way\nAnd many dreams have withered on the vine\nBut dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now\nWe'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through\nHappiness is knowing that you're mine\nWhy worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come\nWe'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes\nEach day is just a gift so don't be blind\nTomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness\nWe'll just live our lives one day at a time\n[ guitar ]\nWe may not have a fortune making plans to change the world\nWe may leave little marks in life's design\nBut as long as we're together every hour is filled with love\nAnd we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...\nWe'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning\nI stared out the window\nAnd I struggled for something to say\nYou left in the rain without closing the door\nI didn't stand in your way\nNow I miss you more\nThan I missed you before\nAnd now where I'll find comfort, god knows\n'Cause you left me\nJust when I needed you most\nYes, you left me\nJust when I needed you most\nNow most every morning\nI stare out the window\nI think about where you might be\nI've written you letters that I'd like to send\nIf you would just send one to me\n'Cause I need you more\nThan I needed before\nAnd now where I'll find comfort, god knows\n'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most\nYes, you left me\nJust when I needed you most\nYou packed in the morning I stared out the window\nAnd I struggled for something to say\nYou left in the rain without closing the door\nI didn't stand in your way Now I love you more\nThan I loved you before\nAnd now where I'll find comfort, god knows\n'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most\nYou left me\nJust when I needed you most\nOh, you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto\nI'm so tired of holding on to nothin'\nThe years have shown no kindness\nFor the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream\nAnd still go right on bluffin'\nWith really nothin' left to hold onto Oh, why do we keep holding on\nWith nothing left to hold onto\nLet's be honest with each other\nThat's the least that we can do\nI feel guilty when they envy me and you\nWe're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken\nVictims of a passion, much too strong to be denied\nWith only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'\nGod only knows how long, how hard we've tried Oh, why do we keep holding on\nWith nothing left to hold onto\nLet's be honest with each other\nThat's the least that we can do\nI

With great anticipation he waited at the door\nHis only son was due from overseas\nFor months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war\nAnd his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home, son\nHis loving arms held open and his heart so full of love\nWelcome home, son\nI've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up\nI knew that you'd return to me\nThe place where you were meant to be\nRest now, for you've been gone too long.\nI hear him say as they embrace\n\"I've waited so long for this day\nMy son, my very own...

You ought to go north somebody told us\n'Cause the air is filled with gold dust\nAnd fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands\nNow I don't recall who said it\nBut we'd spent our lives on credit\nAnd so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk\nWith nothing more than high hopes\nSo we hitched our station wagon to a star\nBut our dreams all fell in on us\n'Cause there was no land of promise\nLord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh, and these northern nights are dreary\nMy old southern heart is weary\nAs I wonder how the old folks are back home\nBut I know that they all love me\nAnd I know they're thinking of me\nAnd Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately\nAbout what's been and what awaits me\nIt takes all I've got to give what life demands\nLord, you go insane if you give in to it\nLife's a mill and I've been through it\nI'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary\nThese old southern eyes are teary\nAs I wonder how the old folks are back home\nBut I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus\nI know He'll love and guide and lead us\nAnd Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father\nHe'll keep my heads above the water\nWhile the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong\nMy home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time\nBut that was before I met you\nI never saw one that I wanted for mine\nBut that was before I met you\nI thought I was swinging the world by the tail\nI thought I could never be blue\nI thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved\nBut that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free\nBut that was before I met you\nI said that no sweet thang could ever hold me\nBut that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail\nI thought I could never be blue\nI thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved\nBut that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day\nWriting a letter to pass time away\nHis little granddaughter climbed up on his knee\nSaying won't you please write a letter for me\nOh, what must I say in this letter I pray\nTell mommy I miss her since she went away\nI'm coming to see her real soon I hope\nHe chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope\nTo god up in heaven you'll get it I hope\nHe stamped it and handed it to her to mail\nHer big eyes were shining, her little face pale\nShe was crossing the street to the box o'er the way\nAnd when she stepped out Never looked either way\nA big object hit her and sped away fast\nThe little girls prayers had been answered at last\nThe postman was passing\nAnd picked up the note\nAddressed to the master\nAnd these words he spoke\nStrait up into heave this letter did go\nShe's happy up there with her mommy I know (Dolly Parton) Hello you said the day we met\nHanding me a yellow rose\nYou asked me out\nAnd to your surprise\nAnd to mine I said I'd go\nI thought it so romantic\nAnd I found you sweet and bold\nThough we'd only met\nI still said yes\nTo a single yellow rose And for years to come\nYou were the one\nTo sleep with me at night\nTo laugh and talk\nAnd share my thoughts\nAnd hold me when I'd cry\nAnd on every occasion\nAnd for no good reason to\nA big bouquet or a single yellow rose\nWas sent from you Yellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go\nYellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds\nI still love you so I never see a yellow rose\nThat I didn't think of you\nIt's still my favorite flower\nThough the yellow's turned to blue\nThe day you left my teardrops fell\nUpon your farewell not\nYou said goodbye like you said hello\nWith a single yellow rose Yellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go\nYellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds\nOh I still love you so Yellow roses\nThe color of sunshine\nYou loved me at one time\nWhy did you have to go\nSweet yellow roses\nAre you sending your new love\nMy bright yellow rose buds\nI still love you so Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party\nAnd two doors down they're not aware that I'm around\nHere I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry\nBut they're having a party just two doors down I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together\nI think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around\n'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever\nI think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party\nAnd two doors down they're all aware that I'm around\nHere I am no longer crying and feeling sorry\nWe're having a party just two doors down I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'\nMaking conversation with the new love I've found\nI ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'\nDown the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party\nAnd two doors down we're not aware that they're around\n'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry\nWe're having our own party two doors down Oh oh

Grassy Branch\nFine as he can be\nI met him at the big barn dance\nAnd he took a shine to me\nSky-blue eyes, a big wide smile\nAnd tall as a sycamore tree\nHe's real smart with a real big heart\nAnd he's gonna marry me\nHe's gonna marry me\nAnd we're gonna go to town\nWe're gonna buy some real good car\nAnd we're gonna drive around\nWe'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug\nHe talks so sweet to

free\nCut momma's apron strings\nHe's gonna build me a pretty little house\nHave a pretty little babe of three\nCause he done kiss me on the mouth\nAn' he's gonna marry me Yeah, he's gonna marry

he's gotta marry me\nYeah he's done kiss me on the mouth\nAnd he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred\nAnd all the windows fastened down\nI spent the night in sleeplessness\nAnd rose at every sound\nHalf in hope of sorrow\nAnd half in fear the day\nWould find the soldiers breakin' through\nTo drag us all away\nAnd just before the sunrise\nI heard something at the wall\nThe gate began to rattle\nAnd a voice began to call\nI hurried to the window\nLooked down into the street\nExpecting swords and torches\nAnd the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary\nSo I went down to let her in\nJohn stood there beside me\nAs she told me where she'd been\nShe said they've moved Him in the night\nAnd none of us know where\nThe stone's been rolled away\nAnd now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden\nThen John ran on ahead\nWe found the stone and empty tomb\nJust the way that Mary said\nBut the winding sheet they wrapped Him in\nWas just an empty shell\nAnd how or where they'd taken Him\nWas more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there\nJust what I did not know\nJohn believed a miracle\nBut I just turned to go\nCircumstance and speculation\nCouldn't lift me very high\n'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him\nThen I saw Him die Back inside the house again\nThe guilt and anguish came\nEverything I'd promised Him\nJust added to my shame\nWhen at last it came to choices\nI denied I knew His name\nAnd even if He was alive\nIt wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled\nWith a strange and sweet perfume\nLight that came from everywhere\nDrove shadows from the room\nAnd Jesus stood before me\nWith His arms held open wide\nAnd I fell down on my knees\nAnd I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet\nAnd as I looked into His eyes\nThe love was shining out from Him\nLike sunlight from the skies\nGuilt in my confusion\nDisappeared in sweet release\nAnd every fear I ever had\nJust melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive\nYes He's alive and I'm forgiven\nHeaven's gates are open wide\nHe's alive yes He's alive\nOh He's alive and I'm forgiven\nHeaven's gates are open wide\nHe's alive He's alive\nHallelujah He's alive\nHe's alive and I'm forgiven\nHeaven's gates are open wide\nHe's alive He's alive He's alive\nI believe it He's alive\nSweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place\nFor a country girl with a friendly face\nIf you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong\nThe greenest state in the land of the free\nAnd the home of the Grand Ole Opry\nIs calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole\nAnd was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole\nEating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite\nLife ain't as simple as it used to be\nJust since the big apple took a bite out of me\nAnd Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when\nIf I had it all to do over again\nTonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed\nWhat I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste\nOf Mama's homemade chocolate cake\nTennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed\nJust as soon as I can I'm gonna head\nBack to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon\nDaddy you can load the rifles up\nWe're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck\nAnd head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when\nIf I had it all to do over again\nTonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed\nEatin' grits and gravy and country ham\nGo to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds\nTennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when\nIf I had it all to do over again\nTonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed\nGood Lord, have mercy on a country girl\nTryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world\nIt's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world\nWith Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head\nI've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head\nTennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton\nWhen our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings\nWinter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten\nJust sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies\nAnd we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring\nAnd they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies\nSittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies\nWhy did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring\nWhy do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby\nSittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases\nAnd the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings\nWhen the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces\nSittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton\nWhen our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings\nBut the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten\nSittin' on the front porch swing\nSittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin'\n\"Dolly, what's your secret?\nWith all you do, your attitude\nJust seems to be so good\nHow do you keep it?\"\nWell, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try\nTo offer up a few words of advice. Chorus:\nYou better get to livin', givin'\nDon't forget to throw in a little forgivin'\nAnd lovin' on the way\nYou better get to knowin', showin'\nA little bit more concerned about where you're goin'\nJust a word unto the wise\nYou better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house\nStarted cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening\nShe was spinnin' such a sad tale\nI could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'\nSo negative the words she had to say\nI said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin', givin'\nBe willing and forgivin'\nCause all healing has to start with you\nYou better stop whining, pining\nGet your dreams in line\nAnd then just shine, design, refine\nUntil they come true\nAnd you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck, your house is mess\nAnd your wardrobe way outdated\nAll your plans just keep on falling through\nOverweight and under paid, under appreciated\nI'm no guru, but I'll tell you\nThis I know is true. You better get to livin', givin'\nA little more thought about bein'\nA little more willin' to make a better way\nDon't sweat the small stuff\nKeep your chin up\nJust hang tough\nAnd if it gets too rough\nFall on your knees and pray\nAnd do that everyday\nThen you'll get to livin'. The day we're born we start to die\nDon't waste one minute of this life\nGet to livin'\nShare your dreams and share your laughter\nMake some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin'\nBetter start sharin'\nBetter start tryin'\nBetter start smiling\nAnd you better get to livin'...
