everythang is goin wrong man\nIm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN\nVerse\nI try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up\nAnd usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up\nBut I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts\nAnd i get hit up with all kinda stress\nAnd put up wit the stuff trust me its tough\nBut I mantain to climb through it all\nAnd I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball\nAnd dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow\nAnd I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall\nAnd Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution\nand someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion\nAnd I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it\nCas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me\nSo if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit\nAnd plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest\nAnd I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do\nBut jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through\nChorus x\nVerse\nWho would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic\nBut I chose my own life so I gradually accept it\nIm influenced and effected by the way it became\nAnd I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game\nAnd even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change\nIm always street so Ill forever be facin a change\nAnd Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants\nAnd I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man\nAnd if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it\nTake care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit\nAnd Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last\nBut when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path\nAnd I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me\nBut dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me\nNow you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone\nAnd I dawg I do believe Im grown\nso Ill be good on my own but
