[{"text": "I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies\nAnd I couldn't keep from crying\nYou sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me\nAnd I couldn't keep from crying\nI saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms\nHim with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place\nI stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss\nAnd I couldn't keep from crying I saw his eyes drinking your charms... I love that hair, long an' black\nHangin' down to the middle of your back\nDon't cut it off whatever you do\nI need it to run my fingers through 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar\nDon't mean maybe, you're my, baby Got me a dollar that I saved\nSaved it up for a rainy day\nEverybody's callin' for bills that's due\nBut they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you 'Cause

don't mean maybe\nYou drive me crazy\nI love you, baby, you're my, babydoll Love is a burnin' thing\nAnd it makes a fiery ring\nBound by wild desire\nI fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire\nI went down, down, down\nAnd the flames went higher\nAnd it burns, burns, burns\nThe ring of fire, the ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire\nI went down, down, down\nAnd the flames went higher\nAnd it burns, burns, burns\nThe ring of fire, the ring of fire The taste of love is sweet\nWhen hearts like ours meet\nI fell for you like a child\nOh, but the fire went wild I fell into a burnin' ring of fire\nI went down, down, down\nAnd the flames went higher\nAnd it burns, burns, burns\nThe ring of fire, the ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire\nI went down,

fire\nThe ring of fire I hurt myself today\nTo see if I still feel\nI focus on the pain\nThe only thing that's real The needle tears a hole\nThe old familiar sting\nTry to kill it all away\nBut I remember everything What have I become\nMy sweetest friend\nEveryone I know\nGoes away in the end And you could have it all\nMy empire of dirt\nI will let you down\nI will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns\nUpon my liars chair\nFull of broken thoughts\nI cannot repair Beneath the stains of time\nThe feelings disappear\nYou are someone else\nI am still right here What have I become\nMy sweetest friend\nEveryone I know\nGoes away in the end And you could have it all\nMy empire of dirt\nI will let you down\nI will make you hurt If I could start again\nA million miles away\nI will keep myself\nI would find a way I hear the train a comin'\nIt's rollin' 'round the bend\nAnd I ain't seen the sunshine\nSince, I don't know when\nI'm stuck in Folsom Prison\nAnd time keeps draggin' on\nBut that train keeps a-rollin'\nOn down to San Antone When I was just a baby\nMy Mama told me, son\nAlways be a good boy\nDon't ever play with guns\nBut I shot a man in Reno\nJust to watch him die\nWhen I hear that whistle blowin'\nI hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin'\nIn a fancy dining car\nThey're probably drinkin' coffee\nAnd smokin' big cigars\nBut I know I had it comin'\nI know I can't be free\nBut those people keep a-movin'\nAnd that's what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison\nIf that railroad train was mine\nI bet I'd move out over a little\nFarther down the line\nFar from Folsom Prison\nThat's where I want to stay\nAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle\nBlow my blues away Well, I woke up Sunday morning\nWith no way to hold my head that didn't hurt\nAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad\nSo I had one more for dessert\nThen I fumbled in my closet through my clothes\nAnd found my cleanest dirty shirt\nThen I washed my face and combed my hair\nAnd stumbled down the stairs to meet the day I'd smoked my mind the night before\nWith cigarettes and songs I'd been picking\nBut I lit my first and watched a small kid\nPlaying with a can that he was kicking\nThen I walked across the street\nAnd caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken\nAnd Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost\nSomewhere, somehow along the way On a Sunday morning sidewalk\nI'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned\n'Cause there's something in a Sunday\nThat makes a body feel alone\nAnd there's nothing short a' dying\nThat's half as lonesome as the sound\nOf the sleeping city sidewalk\nAnd Sunday morning coming down In the park I saw a daddy\nWith a laughing little girl that he was swinging\nAnd I stopped beside a Sunday school\nAnd listened to the songs they were singing\nThen I headed down the street\nAnd somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing\nAnd it echoed through the canyons\nLike the disappearing dreams of yesterday On a Sunday morning sidewalk\nI'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned\n'Cause there's something in a Sunday\nThat makes a body feel alone\nAnd there's nothing short a' dying\nThat's half as lonesome as the sound\nOf the sleeping city sidewalk\nAnd Sunday morning coming down You can run on for a long time\nRun on for a long time\nRun on for a long time\nSooner or later God'll cut you down\nSooner or later God'll cut

Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news\nMy head's been wet with the midnight dew\nI've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee\nHe spoke to me in the voice so sweet\nI

Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'\nAnd we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went... I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.\nI keep my eyes wide open all the time.\nI keep the ends out for the tie that binds.\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line. I find it very, very easy to be true.\nI find myself alone when each day is through.\nYes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line. As sure as night is dark and day is light.\nI keep you on my mind both day and night.\nAnd happiness I've known proves that it's right\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line. You've got a way to keep me on your side.\nYou give me cause for love that I can't hide.\nFor you I know I'd even try to turn the tide.\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line. My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf\nSo it stood ninety years on the floor\nIt was taller by half than the old man himself\nThough it weighed not a pennyweight more It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born\nAnd was always his treasure and pride\nBut it stopped, short never to go again\nWhen the old man died Ninety years without slumbering\nHis life seconds numbering\nIt stopped, short never to go again\nWhen the old man died My grandfather said that of those he could hire\nNot a servant so faithful he found\nFor it wasted no time and had but one desire\nAt the close of each week to be wound And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face\nAnd its hands never hung by its side\nBut it stopped short, never to go again\nWhen the old man died It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night\nAn alarm that for years had been dumb\nAnd we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight\nThat his hour for departure had come Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime\nAs we silently stood by his side\nBut it stopped short, never to go again\nWhen the old man died Ninety years without slumbering\nHis life seconds numbering\nIt stopped short, never to go again\nWhen the old man died Some glad morning when this life is o'er,\nI'll fly away.\nTo that home on God's celestial shore,\nI'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.\nWhen I die, Hallelujah, by and by,\nI'll fly away.\nJust a few more weary days and then,\nI'll fly away. To that land where joy will never end,\nI'll fly away.\nI'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.\nWhen I die, Hallelujah, by and by,\nI'll fly away. Oh I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning\nWhen I die, Hallelujah, by and by,\nI'll fly away. Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,\nWhy you never see bright colors on my back,\nAnd why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.\nWell, there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,\nLivin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,\nI wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,\nBut is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who never read,\nOr listened to the words that Jesus said,\nAbout the road to happiness through love and charity,\nWhy, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,\nIn our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,\nBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,\nUp front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old,\nFor the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,\nI wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,\nEach week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,\nBelieven' that the Lord was on their side,\nI wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,\nBelieven' that we all were on their side. Well, there's things that never will be right I know,\nAnd things need changin' everywhere you go,\nBut 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,\nYou'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,\nAnd tell the world that everything's OK,\nBut I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,\n'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds\nI took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down\nI went right home and I went to bed\nI stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head. Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun\nTook a shot of cocaine and away I run\nMade a good run but I run too slow\nThey overtook me down in Juarez Mexico. Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill\nIn walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill\nHe said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown\nYou're the dirty hack that shot your woman down. I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee\nIf you've got a warrant just read it to me\nShot her down cause she made me slow\nI thought I was her daddy but she had five more. When I was arrested I was dressed in black\nThey put me on a train and they took me back\nHad no friends for to go my bail\nThey slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail. Early next morning about a half past nine\nI spied a sheriff comin' down the line\nCoughed and coughed as he cleared his throat\nHe said come on you dirty hack into that district court Into the court room my trial began\nWhere I was handled by twelve honest men\nJust before the jury started out\nI saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes in walked a man\nHolding the verdict in his right hand\nThe verdict read in the first degree\nI hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen\nNinety nine years in the Folsom pen\nNinety nine years underneath that ground\nI can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down\nCome on you gotta listen unto me\nLay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling\nFrom glen to glen and down the mountain side\nThe summer's gone, and all the roses falling\nIt's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide But come ye back when summer's in the meadow\nOr when the valley's hushed and white with snow\nI'll be here in sunshine or in shadow\nOh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so But if you come, and all the flowers are dying\nAnd I am dead, as dead I well may be\nYou'll come and find the place where I am lying\nAnd kneel and say an \"Ave\" there for me And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me\nAnd then my grave will richer, sweeter be\nAnd you'll bend down and tell me that you love me\nAnd I will rest in peace until you come to me There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart\nFor the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there\nIn the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore\nIn the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore We shall meet on the beautiful shore\nWe shall sing on that beautiful shore for the melodious songs of the blessed\nAnd our spirits shall sorrow no more not a sight for the blessing of rest\nIn the sweet by and by To a bountiful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise\nFor the glory as gift of his love and the blessing that howlered days\nIn the sweet by and by\nIn the sweet by and by If you're travelin' in the north country fair\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\nRemember me to one who lives there\nOh she once was a true love of mine See for me if her hair's hanging down\nIt curls and falls all down her breast\nSee for me that her hair's hanging down\nThat's the way I remember her best If you go when the snowflakes falls\nWhen the rivers freeze and summer ends\nPlease see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm\nTo keep her from the howlin' winds If you're travelin' in the north country fair\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\nPlease say \"hello\" to the one who lives there\nOh she was once a true love of mine If you're travelin' in the north country fair\nWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderline\nRemember me to one who lives there\nOh she once was a true love of mine A true love of mine\nA true love of mine\nTrue love of mine\nA true love of mine\nA true love of mine\nShe was once a true love of mine I keep a close watch on this heart of mine\nI keep my eyes wide open all the time\nI keep the ends out for the tie that binds\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line I find it very, very easy to be true\nI find myself alone when each day's through\nYes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light\nI keep you on my mind both day and night\nAnd happiness I've known proves that it's right\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side\nYou give me cause for love that I can't hide\nFor you I know I'd even try to turn the tide\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine\nI keep my eyes wide open all the time\nI keep the ends out for the tie that binds\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,\nAnd I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.\nAnd the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.\nThen I'm gonna sit right here until I die. I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).\nAnd it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.\nThen I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,\nAnd I followed you, Big River, when you called. Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).\nA freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.\nI found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.\nShe raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone. Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.\nTake that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.\nGo on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.\nShe loves you, Big River, more than me. Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry\nAnd I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.\nAnd the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.\nThen I'm gonna sit right here until I die. There ain't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nWhen I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground\nAin't no grave can hold my body down Well, look way down the river, what do you think I see?\nI see a band of angels and they're coming after me\nAin't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, look down yonder Gabriel, put your feet on the land and see\nBut Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nAin't no grave can hold my body down Well, meet me Jesus, meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air\nAnd if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere\nAin't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road\nAnd momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load\nAin't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down I want to live,\nI want to give\nI've been a miner for a heart of gold.\nIt's these expressions I never give\nThat keeps me searching for a heart of gold\nAnd I'm getting old.\nIt keeps me searching for a heart of gold\nAnd I'm getting old. I've been to Hollywood\nI've been to redwood\nI crossed the ocean for a heart of gold\nI've been in my mind, it's such a fine line\nThat keeps me searching for a heart of gold\nAnd I'm getting old.\nIt keeps me searching for a heart of gold\nAnd I'm getting old. You keep me searching for a heart of gold\nI've been a miner for a heart of gold.\nAnd I'm getting old. Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine\nAn' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line\nThe first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by\nAnd sometimes I'd hang my head and cry\n'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. One day I devised myself a plan\nThat should be the envy of most any man\nI'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand\nNow gettin' caught meant gettin' fired\nBut I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired\nI'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. I'd get it one piece at a time\nAnd it wouldn't cost me a dime\nYou'll know it's me when I come through your town\nI'm gonna ride around in style\nI'm gonna drive everybody wild\n'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. So the very next day when I punched in\nWith my big lunchbox and with help from my friends\nI left that day with a lunch box full of gears\nI've never considered myself a thief\nBut GM wouldn't miss just one little piece\nEspecially if I strung it out over several years. The first day I got me a fuel pump\nAnd the next day I got me an engine and a trunk\nThen I got me a transmission and all the chrome\nThe little things I could get in my big lunchbox\nLike nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks\nBut the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. Now, up to now my plan went all right\n'Til we tried to put it all together one night\nAnd that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a fifty three\nAnd the motor turned out to be a seventy three\nAnd when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. So we drilled it out so that it would fit\nAnd with a little bit of help with an adapter kit\nWe had that engine runnin' just like a song\nNow the headlight' was another sight\nWe had two on the left and one on the right\nBut when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on. The back end looked kinda funny too\nBut we put it together and when we got through\nWell, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin\nAbout that time my wife walked out\nAnd I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts\nBut she opened the door and said \"Honey, take me for a spin.\" So we drove up town just to get the tags\nAnd I headed her right on down main drag\nI could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around\nBut up there at the court house they didn't laugh\n'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff\nAnd when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds. I got it one piece at a time\nAnd it wouldn't cost me a dime\nYou'll know it's me when I come through your town\nI'm gonna ride around in style\nI'm gonna drive everybody wild\n'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. Ugh! Yeah, RED RYDER\nThis is the COTTON MOUTH\nIn the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH\nAnd negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER\nYou might say I went right up to the factory\nAnd picked it up, it's cheaper that way\nUgh!, what model is it? Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56\n'57, '58' 59' automobile\nIt's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67\n'68, '69, '70 automobile. Ten years ago, on a cold dark night\nSomeone was killed, 'neath the town hall light\nThere were few at the scene, but they all agreed\nThat the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me She walks these hills in a long black veil\nShe visits my grave when the night winds wail\nNobody knows, nobody sees\nNobody knows but me The judge said son, what is your alibi\nIf you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die\nI spoke not a word, thou it meant my life\nI'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife Did I hear someone applaud? Now the scaffold is high and eternity's near\nShe stood in the crowd and shed not a tear\nBut sometimes at night, when the north wind moans\nIn a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones She walks these hills in a long black veil\nShe visits my grave when the night winds wail\nNobody knows, nobody sees\nNobody knows but me Can I have a glass of water?\nhuh?

baby\nMy Mama told me, \"Son\nAlways be a good boy\nDon't ever play with guns\" But I shot a man in Reno\nJust to watch him die\nWhen I hear that whistle blowin'\nI hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin'\nFrom a fancy dining car\nThey're probably drinkin' coffee\nAnd smokin' big cigars Well, I know I had it comin'\nI know I can't be free\nBut those people keep a-movin'\nAnd that's what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison\nIf that railroad train was mine\nI bet I'd move it all a little\nFarther down the line Far from Folsom Prison\nThat's where I want to stay\nAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle\nBlow my blues away \"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder\nOne of the four beasts saying,\n'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold a white horse\" There's a man goin' 'round takin' names\nAnd he decides who to free and who to blame\nEverybody won't be treated all the same\nThere'll be a golden ladder reachin' down\nWhen the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up\nAt the terror in each sip and in each sup\nWill you partake of that last offered cup\nOr disappear into the potter's ground?\nWhen the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers\nOne hundred million angels singin'\nMultitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum\nVoices callin', voices cryin'\nSome are born and some are dyin'\nIt's alpha and omega's kingdom come\nAnd the whirlwind is in the thorn tree\nThe virgins are all trimming their wicks\nThe whirlwind is in the thorn tree\nIt's hard for thee to kick against the pricks Till armageddon no shalam, no shalom\nThen the father hen will call his chickens home\nThe wise man will bow down before the throne\nAnd at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns\nWhen the man comes around Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still\nWhoever is righteous let him be righteous still\nWhoever is filthy let him be filthy still\nListen to the words long written down\nWhen the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers\nOne hundred million angels singin'\nMultitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum\nVoices callin', voices cryin'\nSome are born and some are dyin'\nIt's alpha and omega's kingdom come\nAnd the whirlwind is in the thorn tree\nThe virgins are all trimming their wicks\nThe whirlwind is in the thorn trees\nIt's hard for thee to kick against the prick\nIn measured hundredweight and penny pound\nWhen the man comes around \"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts\nAnd I looked, and behold a pale horse\nAnd his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him\" Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed\nWhere the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold\nWhere the miles are marked in the blood and gold\nI'll meet you further on up the road

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.\nJohn Henry said to the steam-drill \"How is you?\nSaid pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.\nI said how are you Huh?\nCan you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?\nListen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you. Two-thousand people hollered, \"Go John Henry!\"\nThen somebody hollered,\" The mountain's cavin' in!\"\nJohn Henry told the captin, \"Tell the kind-folks not to worry\nIt ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'\nThis steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin. \"Captain tell the people to move back farther\nI'm at the finish line and ain't no drill\nIt's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it\nWhen she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord\nWhen she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills\" Now, John Henry had a little woman\nI believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman\nJohn Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home\nEarly next mornin' he said,\n\"Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.\nSaid you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up\nAnd I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up\nThat I couldn't come up with it\nHe said, (dirty mind),\nHe said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad\nAnd when you swinging with that lead man\nYou tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,\nI can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.\nAin't no machine can that's been proved to you! There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house\nThe section hands laid him in the sand\nTrains go by on the rails John Henry laid.\nThey slow down and take off the hats,\nWhen they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.\nThey say,\"Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger.\"\nThen they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.\nClickity clack Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord\nYonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord\nYonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' Thank you very much\nYou know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia\nDigin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.\nAnd he was a mighty big man they say\nThat from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet\nBoy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke Ira Hayes...\nIra Hayes...\nCall him drunken Ira Hayes,\nHe won't answer anymore,\nNot the whiskey drinking Indian,\nOr the marine that went to war. Gather 'round me people,\nThere's a story I would tell,\n'Bout a brave young Indian,\nYou should remember well.\nFrom the land of the Pima Indian,\nA proud and noble band,\nWho farmed the Phoenix Valley,\nIn Arizona land.\nDown the ditches a thousand years,\nThe waters grew Ira's peoples' crops,\n'Til the white man stole their water rights,\nAnd the sparkling water stopped.\nNow, Ira's folks were hungry,\nAnd their land grew crops of weeds,\nWhen war came, Ira volunteered,\nAnd forgot the white man's greed. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,\nHe won't answer anymore,\nNot the whiskey drinking Indian,\nOr the marine that went to war. There they battled up Iwo Jima hill,\nTwo hundred and fifty men,\nBut only twenty-seven lived,\nTo walk back down again.\nAnd when the fight was over,\nAnd Old Glory raised,\nAmong the men who held it high,\nWas the Indian, Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,\nHe won't answer anymore,\nNot the whiskey drinking Indian,\nOr the marine that went to war. Ira Hayes returned a hero,\nCelebrated through the land,\nHe was wined and speeched and honored,\nEverybody shook his hand,\nBut he was just a Pima Indian,\nNo water, no home, no chance,\nAt home nobody cared what Ira'd done,\nAnd when did the Indians dance. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,\nHe won't answer anymore,\nNot the whiskey drinking Indian,\nOr the marine that went to war. Then Ira started drinking hard,\nJail was often his home,\nThey let him raise the flag and lower it\nLike you'd throw a dog a bone.\nHe died drunk early one morning,\nAlone in the land he fought to save,\nTwo inches of water and a lonely ditch,\nWas a grave for Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,\nHe won't answer anymore,\nNot the whiskey drinking Indian,\nOr the marine that went to war. Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes,\nBut his land is just as dry,\nAnd his ghost is lying thirsty,\nIn the ditch where Ira died. Life is like a mountain railway\nWith an engineer that's brave\nWe must make the run successful\nFrom the cradle to the grave Heed the curves and watch the tunnels\nNever falter, never fail\nKeep your hand upon the throttle\nAnd your eye upon the rail Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us\nTill we reach that blissful shore\nWhere the angels wait to join us\nIn that train forevermore Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us\nTill we reach that blissful shore\nWhere the angels wait to join us\nIn God's grace forevermore To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day\nHardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,\nNo one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip\nThe stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip It was early in the morning when he rode into the town\nHe came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around\n\"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'\", came a whisper from each lip\n\"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip\" In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red\nMany men had tried to take him and that many men were dead\nHe was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four\nAnd the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,\nOne and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around\nWas an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town\nHe was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead\nAnd he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,\nAfter Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red\nBut the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead\nTwenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,\nTwenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet\nIt was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street\nFolks were watchin' from their windows,\nEvery body held their breath,\nThey knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,\nAbout to meet his death There was twenty feet between them\nWhen they stopped to make their play\nAnd the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today\nTexas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped\nAnd the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round\nThere before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground\nOh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip\nWhen he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip Big iron, big iron,\nOh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,\nBig iron on his hip How high's the water, mama?\nTwo feet high and risin'\nHow high's the water, papa?\nShe said it's two feet high and risin' We can make it to the road in a homemade boat\nThat's the only thing we got left that'll float\nIt's already over all the wheat and oats,\nTwo feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?\nThree feet high and risin'\nHow high's the water, papa?\nShe said it's three feet high and risin' Well, the hives are gone,\nI lost my bees\nThe chickens are sleepin'\nIn the willow trees\nCow's in water up past her knees,\nThree feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?\nFour feet high and risin'\nHow high's the water, papa?\nShe said it's four feet high and risin' Hey, come look through the window pane,\nThe bus is coin', gonna take us to the train\nLooks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain,\nFour feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?\nFive feet high and risin'\nHow high's the water, papa?\nShe said it's five feet high and risin' Well the rails are washed out north of town\nWe gotta head for higher ground\nWe can't come back till the water goes down,\nFive feet high and risin' Well, it's five feet high and risin' (When he reached down his hand for me)\nOnce my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be\nBut my Saviour in love gave me peace from above\nWhen he reached down his hand for me\nWhen he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me\nI was lost and undone without my God or his son\nWhen he reached down his hand for me\n[ guitar ]\nI was near to despair when he came to me there\nAnd he showed me that I could be free\nThen he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete\nWhen he reached down his hand for me\nWhen he reached down...
