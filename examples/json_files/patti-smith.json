afternoon, dreaming hotel\nWe just had the quarrel that sent you away.\nI was looking for you, are you gone gone?\nCalled you on the phone, another dimension.\nWell, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.\nI went looking for you, are you gone, gone?\n\nDown by the ocean it was so dismal,\nWomen all standing with a shock on their faces.\nSad description, oh I was looking for you.\n\nEveryone was singing, girl is washed up\nOn Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.\nI was looking for you, are you gone gone?\nPretty little girl, everyone cried.\nShe was the victim of sweet suicide.\nI went looking for you, are you gone gone?\n\nDown by the ocean it was so dismal,\nWomen all standing with shock on their faces.\nSad description, oh I was looking for you.\n\nDesk clerk told me girl was washed up,\nWas small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now.\nI went looking for you, are you gone gone?\nPicked up my key, didn't reply.\nWent to my room, started to cry.\nYou were small, an angel, are you gone gone?\n\nDown by the ocean it was so dismal.\nI was just standing with shock on my face.\nThe hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you.\nYou'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.\nNever return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.\nGone gone, gone gone, good-bye.\n\n\nHis father died and left him a little farm in New England.\nAll the long black funeral cars left the scene\nAnd the boy was just standing there alone\nLooking at the shiny red tractor\nHim and his daddy used to sit inside\nAnd circle the blue fields and grease the night.\nIt was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars\n'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.\nThen he put his head in the crux of his arm\nAnd he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,\nLet the ship slide open, and he went inside of it\nAnd saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,\nHe saw his daddy 'hind the control board,\nAnd he was very different tonight\n'Cause he was not human, he was not human.\n\nAnd then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy\nThat the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,\nWhite lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly\nAnd he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,\nNo black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven\nAnd fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,\n\u201cNo, daddy, don't leave me here alone,\nTake me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,\nLet the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it\nWhere you're not human, you are not human.\u201d\n\nBut nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.\nNobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm\nAnd they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered\nAnd they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet\nSlit in his nose and all the others went shooting\nAnd he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake\nGrabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,\nAll his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,\n\u201cI won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,\nI won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,\nTake me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship\nAnd the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.\u201d\n\nI am helium raven and this movie is mine,\nSo he cried out as he stretched the sky,\nPushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?\nWe'll just be dreaming of animation night and day\nAnd won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,\nOh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,\nIt's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights\nMoving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,\nAnd he put up his hands and he said, \u201cIt's me, it's me,\nI'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,\nI'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,\nDon't let me here,\u201d the son, the sign, the cross,\nLike the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,\nThe mother standing in the doorway letting her sons\nNo longer presidents but prophets\nThey're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,\nHe's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation\nIt's all gonna split his skull\nIt's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining\nLike a fist that's gonna shoot them up\nLike light, like Mohammed Boxer\nTake them up up up up up up\nOh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,\nI'm going up, I'm going up\nTake me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there\nGo up go up go up go up up up up up up up\nUp, up to the belly of a ship.\nLet the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it\nWhere we are not human, we're not human.\n\nWell, there was sand, there were tiles,\nThe sun had melted the sand and it coagulated\nLike a river of glass\nWhen it hardened he looked at the surface\nHe saw his face\nAnd where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,\nWhere there were eyes there were just two white opals\nAnd he looked up and the rays shot\nAnd he saw raven comin' in\nAnd he crawled on his back and he went up\nUp up up up up up\nSha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,\nSha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,\nSha da

need.\n\nEvery night before I rest my head\nSee those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.\nI know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.\nI take that money, buy you things you never had.\n\nOh, baby, it would mean so much to me,\nOh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.\nI'll buy you a jet plane, baby,\nGet you on a higher plane to a jet stream\nAnd take you through the stratosphere\nAnd check out the planets there and then take you down\nDeep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow\nAnd we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.\nWhen we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,\nWe'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,\nFree money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money.\n\nEvery night before I go to sleep\nFind a ticket, win a lottery.\nEvery night before I rest my head\nSee those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.\n\nOh, baby, it would mean so much to me,\nBaby, I know our troubles will be gone.\nOh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone\nIf we dream, dream, dream for free.\nAnd when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,\nLet's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,\nFree money, free money, free money, [X7]\nFree money, free money, free money, free.\n\n\nThe wall is high, the black barn,\nThe babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes\nAnd I know soon that the sky will split\nAnd the planets will shift,\nBalls of jade will drop and existence will stop.\nLittle sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.\nLittle sister, the fates are calling on you.\n\nAh, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,\nThe sea rushes up my knees like flame\nAnd I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc\nAnd the cause is you lookin' up at me.\nOh baby, I remember when you were born,\nIt was dawn and the storm settled in my belly\nAnd I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas\nAnd I lit a match and the void went flash\nAnd the sky split and the planets hit,\nBalls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.\nLittle sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.\nLittle sister, the fates are calling on you.\n\nI was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,\nSo with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.\nAh, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,\nSo I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces\nBurst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,\nAnd I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.\nYour soul was like a network of spittle,\nLike glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,\nAnd I prayed as the lightning attacked\nThat something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,\nSomething will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.\n\nThe palm trees fall into the sea,\nIt doesn't matter much to me\nAs long as you're safe, Kimberly.\nAnd I can gaze deep\nInto your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\nLooking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\nInto your starry eyes, oh.\n\nOh, in your starry eyes, baby,\nLooking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.\n\nOh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,\nInto your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby\n\n\nCar stopped in a clearing,\nRibbon of life, it was nearing.\nI saw the boy break out of his skin.\nMy heart turned over and I crawled in.\nHe cried, \"Break it up, oh I don't understand,\nBreak it up, I can't comprehend.\nBreak it up, oh, I want to feel you.\nBreak it up, don't talk to me that way,\nI'm not listening.\"\n\nSnow started falling,\nI could hear the angel calling.\nWe rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.\nThe boy flew away and he started to sing.\nHe sang, \"Break it up, oh, I don't understand.\nBreak it up, I can't comprehend.\nBreak it up, oh, I want to feel you.\nBreak it up, don't look at me.\"\n\nThe sky was raging, the boy disappeared,\nI fell on my knee\nAtmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.\nI cried, \"Take me please!\"\n\nIce, it was shining.\nI could feel my heart, it was melting.\nI tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.\nI ripped my skin open and then I broke through.\nI cried, \"Break it up, oh, now I understand.\nBreak it up, and I want to go.\nBreak it up, oh please take me with you.\nBreak it up, I can feel it breaking,\nI can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,\nI can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.\" \n\nSo break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.\nBreak it up, now I'm gonna go.\nBreak it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.\nBreak it up, break it up, break it up,\nBreak it up, break it up, break it up,\nOh, break it up,

break it up ...\n\n\nThe boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea\nFrom the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating\nAnother boy was sliding up the hallway\nHe merged perfectly with the hallway,\nHe merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway\n\nThe boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,\nbut the movie kept moving as planned\nThe boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,\nHe drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny\nThe boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,\nstarted crashing his head against the locker,\nstarted crashing his head against the locker,\nstarted laughing hysterically\n\nWhen suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by\nhorses, horses, horses, horses\ncoming in in all directions\nwhite shining silver studs with their nose in flames,\nHe saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.\nDo you know how to pony like bony maroney\nDo you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this\nBaby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator\nAnd you twist the twister like your baby sister\nI want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister\nRise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,\nRoll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,\nGot to lose control and then you take control,\nThen you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,\nLike it like that, like it like that, like it like that,\nThen you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi\n\nLife is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin\nAngel looks down at him and says, \u201cOh, pretty boy,\nCan't you show me nothing but surrender?\u201d\nJohnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,\nTaped to his chest there's the answer,\nYou got pen knives and jack knives and\nSwitchblades preferred, switchblades preferred\nThen he cries, then he screams, saying\nLife is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain\nAnd I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,\nGo Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,\nAnd go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi\n\nThere's a little place, a place called space\nIt's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,\nAcross the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,\nYou like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,\nAnd the name of the band is the\nTwistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,\nTwistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes\n\nBaby calm down, better calm down,\nIn the night, in the eye of the forest\nThere's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,\nI put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,\nI didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that\nup there -- there is a sea\nup there -- there is a sea\nup there -- there is a sea\nthe sea's the possibility\nThere is no land but the land\n(up there is just a sea of possibilities)\nThere is no sea but the sea\n(up there is a wall of possibilities)\nThere is no keeper but the key\n(up there there are several walls of possibilities)\nExcept for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.\n(up there)\nI seize the first possibility, is the sea around me\nI was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor\n(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee\n(on the screen)\nAnd I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame\n(in the heart of man)\nThe waves were coming in like Arabian stallions\nGradually lapping into sea horses\nHe picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat\n(the spoon)\nAnd let it deep in\n(the veins)\nDip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities\nIt started hardening\nDip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities\nIt started hardening in my hand\nAnd I felt the arrows of desire\n\nI put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour\nBut no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area\n(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)\nAnd go Johnny go and do the watusi,\nYeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...\nShined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling\nOur lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining\nYour nerves, your mane of the black shining horse\nAnd my fingers all entwined through the air,\nI could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,\n(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)\nThe hairs were like wires going through my body\nI I that's how I\nthat's how I\nI died\n(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)\n(they knew what they were after)\n[Everything on the current] moved up\nI tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,\nLike playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility\nWas a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities\nThere's no land but the land\n\nlooked at my hands, and there's a red stream\nthat went streaming through the sands like fingers,\nlike arteries, like fingers\n(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)\nHe lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)\nHe opened his throat (your eyes)\nHis vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands\nThe scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,\nNo one heard that cry,\nNo one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,\n(His fingers)\nNobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,\nAnd so he seized the first\n(his vocal chords shot up)\n(possibility)\n(like mad pituitary glands)\nIt was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate\n(there is nothing happening at all)\nand go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep\nsaw this sweet young thing (Fender one)\nHumping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter\n\nIn the sheets\nthere was a man\ndancing around\nto the simple\nRock & roll\nsong\n\n\nI just don't know what to do tonight,\nMy head is aching as I drink and breathe\nMemory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.\n\nThere must be something I can dream tonight,\nThe air is filled with the moves of you,\nAll the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.\n\nTrumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance\nAnd my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad\nThat our friends can't be with us today.\n\n\nMoooooove!

Angeles\n\nHoly New York, holy San Francisco\nHoly Peoria and Seattle, holy Paris\nHoly Tangiers, holy Moscow, holy Istanbul\nHoly time in eternity, body, holy eternity in time\n\nHoly the clocks in space, holy the fourth dimension\nHoly the fifth International, holy the Angel in Moloch\nHoly the sea, holy the desert, holy the railroad\nHoly the locomotive, holy the visions, holy the hallucination\n\nHoly the miracles, holy the eyeball, holy the abyss\nHoly forgiveness, mercy, charity, faith\nHoly ours, bodies suffering magnanimity\nHoly the supernatural, extra brilliant, intelligent, kindness of the soul\n\n\nLower the thing the skin of a cat\nSkin it to the left just laying there\nNo other thing is luck like that\nAnd you set it said it said nothing\n\nWent to the party very discouraged\nI watched the litter pile like a wall\nI looked at the river just couldn't forgive it\nIt was ladened with all kinds of shit\nStill I admit that I didn't say nothing\nI turned my back walked away\nGot to face the fact that I didn't say nothing\n\nEveryone was dancing I stood over in the corner\nI was listening they were saying this and saying that\nAnd putting this one down but nothing was delivered\nNothing good was coming I just stood there\nI couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing\nI walked the floor then I looked away\n\nGot to face the fact that I didn't say nothing\n\nHow long how long will we make do\nMaybe it's time to break on through\nGonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up\nGonna get well I'm gonna do something\nGonna face the fact gonna give it back\nAnd I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue\nWon't hold the thought won't hold the card\nWell I'm gonna do something\nOh my brain I got to complain\nYou can refrain but I'm gonna do something\nHow long how long will we make do\nMaybe it's time to break on through\n\nOut in the desert I saw that old cat skinned\nI saw it floating in the river\nI saw and no one seemed to mind\nThey sat there they sat there watching the sun\nI saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble\nLike dust in the hand and we watched the sun\nSpread its wings and fly away\nAnd in the mountains a cry echoes\nDon't say nothing\nDon't say nothing no\nDon't say nothing no\n\n\nThis dead city longs to be\nThis dead city longs to be free\nSeven screaming horses\nMelt down in the sun\nBuilding scenes on empty dreams\nAnd smoking them one by one\n\nThis dead city longs to be\nThis dead city longs to be living\nIs it any wonder there's squalor in the sun\nWith their broken schemes and their lotteries\nThey never get nowhere\n\nIs it any wonder they're spitting at the sun\nGod's parasites in abandoned sites\nand they never have much fun\n\nIf I was a blind man\nWould you see for me\nOr would you confuse\nThe nature of my blues\nAnd refuse a hand to me\n\nIs it any wonder crying in the sun\nIs it any wonder I'm crying in the sun\nWell I built my dreams on your empty scenes\nNow I'm burning them one by one\n\nThis damn city this dead city\nImmortal city\nMotor city\nSuc-cess city\nLongs to be\nLongs to be\nFree\nFree\nFree\n\n\nMother as I write the sun dissolves\nBlood life streaming cross my hand\nAnd these words, these words\nHope dashed immortal hope\nHope streaking the canvas sky\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\n\nWe joined the long caravan\nHungry dreaming going west\nJust for work just to get a job\nAnd we never got lucky\nWe just forged on\nAnd the dust the endless dust\nLike a plague it covered everything\nHal fell with the fever\nAnd mother I did what I could\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\n\nWe prayed we prayed for rain\nI never wanted to see the sun again\n\nAll my dresses you made by hand\nWe left behind on the road\nHal died in my arms\nWe buried him by the river\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\nBlue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write\n\n\nIn the straw-colored light\nIn light rapidly changing\nOn a life rapidly fading\n\nHave you seen death singing\nHave you seen death singing\n\nWith a throat smooth as a lamb\nYet dry as a branch not snapping\nHe throws back his head\nAnd he does not sing a thing mournful\n\nHave you seen death singing\nHave you seen death singing\nHave you seen death singing\nIn the straw-colored light\n\nHe sings a black embrade\nAnd white opals swimming\nIn a child's leather purse\nHave you seen death swimming\nHave you seen death swimming\n\nWith a throat smooth as a lamb\nYet dry as a branch not snapping\nHe throws back his head\nAnd he does not sing a thing mournful\n\nHave you seen death singing\nHave you seen death singing\nHave you seen death singing\nIn the straw-colored light\n\nHe sings of youth enraged\nAnd the burning of Atlanta\nAnd these viral times\nAnd May ribbons streaming\nAnd straw-colored curls a-turning\nA mother's vain delight\nAnd woe to the sun\nAnd woe to the young\nAnother hearse is drawn\nHave you seen death singing\nIn the straw-colored light\n"}]
