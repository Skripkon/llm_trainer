over\nWandering I am lost\nAs I travel along the white cliffs of Dover Many rivers to cross\nAnd it's only my will that keeps me alive\nI've been licked, washed up for years\nAnd I merely survive because of my pride And this loneliness won't leave me alone\nIt's such a drag to be on your own\nMy woman left me and she didn't say why\nWell I guess, I have to try Many rivers to cross\nBut just

your memories\nUpstream\nTo the meadow in the mountain\nWhere we counted every falling star I believe the light that shines on you\nWill shine on you forever\n(forever)\nAnd though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary\nHidin' under your bed\nI'm gonna\nStand guard\nLike the postcard\nOf the golden retriever\nAnd never leave\n'Til I leave you\nWith a sweet dream in your head I'm gonna watch you

back\nOn all the crap I learned in high school\nIt's a wonder\nI can think at all\nAnd though my lack of education\nHasn't hurt me none\nI can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome\nThey give us those nice bright colors\nThey give us the greens of summers\nMakes you think all the world's a sunny day\nI got a Nikon camera\nI love to take a photograph\nSo mama don't take my Kodachrome away If

problem is all inside your head she said to me\nThe answer is easy if you take it logically\nI'd like to help you in your struggle to be free\nThere must be fifty ways to leave your lover She said it's really not my habit to intrude\nFurthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued\nBut I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude\nThere must be fifty ways to leave your lover\nFifty ways to leave your lover You just slip out the back, Jack\nMake a new plan, Stan\nYou don't need to be coy, Roy\nJust get yourself free\nHop on the bus, Gus\nYou don't need to discuss much\nJust drop off the key, Lee\nAnd get yourself free She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain\nI wish there was something I could do to make you smile again\nI said I appreciate that and would you please explain\nAbout the fifty ways She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight\nAnd I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light\nAnd then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right\nThere must be fifty ways to leave your lover\nFifty ways to leave your lover You just slip out the back, Jack\nMake a new plan, Stan\nYou don't need to be coy, Roy\nJust get yourself free\nHop on the bus, Gus\nYou don't need to discuss much\nJust drop off the key, Lee\nAnd get yourself free A winter's day\nIn a deep and dark\nDecember,\nI am alone,\nGazing from my window to the streets below\nOn a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island. I've built walls,\nA fortress deep and mighty,\nThat none may penetrate.\nI have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain.\nIt's laughter and it's loving I disdain.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island. Don't talk of love,\nBut I've heard the words before;\nIt's sleeping in my memory.\nI won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.\nIf I never loved I never would have cried.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island. I have my books\nAnd my poetry to protect me,\nI am shielded in my armor,\nHiding in my room, safe within my womb.\nI touch no one and no one touches me.\nI am a rock,\nI am an island. And a rock feels no pain,\nAnd an island never cries. The Mississippi Delta was shining\nLike a National guitar\nI am following the river\nDown the highway\nThrough the cradle of the civil war\nI'm going to Graceland\nGraceland\nIn Memphis Tennessee\nI'm going to Graceland\nPoor boys and pilgrims with families\nAnd we are going to Graceland\nMy traveling companion is nine years old\nHe is the child of my first marriage\nBut I've reason to believe\nWe both will be received\nIn Graceland She comes back to tell me she's gone\nAs if I didn't know that\nAs if I didn't know my own bed\nAs if I'd never noticed\nThe way she brushed her hair from her forehead\nAnd she said losing love\nIs like a window in your heart\nEverybody sees you're blown apart\nEverybody sees the wind blow I'm going to Graceland\nMemphis Tennessee\nI'm going to Graceland\nPoor boys and pilgrims with families\nAnd we are going to Graceland And my traveling companions\nAre ghosts and empty sockets\nI'm looking at ghosts and empties\nBut I've reason to believe\nWe all will be received\nIn Graceland There is a girl in New York City\nWho calls herself the human trampoline\nAnd sometimes when I'm falling, flying\nOr tumbling in turmoil I say\nOh, so this is what she means\nShe means we're bouncing into Graceland\nAnd I see losing love\nIs like a window in your heart\nEverybody sees you're blown apart\nEverybody sees the wind blow In Graceland, in Graceland\nI'm going to Graceland\nFor reasons I cannot explain\nThere's some part of me wants to see\nGraceland\nAnd I may be obliged to defend\nEvery love, every ending\nOr maybe there's no obligations now\nMaybe I've a reason to believe\nWe all will be received\nIn Graceland Slip slidin' away\nSlip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away I know a man\nHe came from my home town\nHe wore his passion for his woman\nLike a thorny crown\nHe said Dolores\nI live in fear\nMy love for you's so overpowering\nI'm afraid that I will disappear Slip slidin' away\nSlip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away I know a woman\nBecame a wife\nThese are the very words she uses\nTo describe her life\nShe said a good day\nAin't got no rain\nShe said a bad day's when I lie in bed\nAnd think of things that might have been Slip slidin' away\nSlip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away I know a father\nHe had a son\nHe longed to tell him all the reasons\nFor the things he'd done\nHe came a long way\nJust to explain\nHe kissed his boy as he lay sleeping\nThen he turned around and headed home again Slip slidin' away\nSlip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away God only knows\nGod makes his plans\nThe information's unavailable\nTo the mortal man\nWe work our jobs\nCollect our pay\nBelieve we're gliding down the highway\nWhen in fact we're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away\nSlip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away\nYou know the nearer your destination\nThe more you're slip slidin' away When I was a little boy\nAnd the Devil would call my name\nI'd say \"now who do\nWho do you think you're fooling?\"\nI'm a consecrated boy\nSinger in a Sunday choir\nMy mama loves, she loves me\nShe gets down on her knees and hugs me\nShe loves me like a rock\nShe rocks me like the rock of ages\nAnd she loves me\nShe loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me When I was grown to be a man\nAnd the Devil would call my name\nI'd say \"now who do\nWho do you think you're fooling?\"\nI'm a consummated man\nI can snatch a little purity\nMy mama loves me, she loves me\nShe gets down on her knees and hugs me\nShe loves me like a rock\nShe rocks me like the rock of ages\nAnd she loves me\nShe loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me If I was President\nAnd the Congress call my name\nI'd say \"who do\nWho do you think you're fooling?\"\nI've got the Presidential Seal\nI'm up on the Presidential Podium\nMy mama loves me\nShe loves me\nShe gets down on her knees and hugs me\nAnd she loves me like a rock\nShe rocks me like the rock of ages\nAnd she loves me\nShe loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me\nShe loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me\nShe loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me Blues Run the Game Lyrics\nWritten by Jackson C.Frank Catch a boat to England, baby,\nMaybe to Spain,\nWherever I have gone,\nWherever I've been and gone,\nWherever I have gone\nThe blues have run the game. Send out for whisky, baby,\nSend out for gin,\nMe and room service, honey,\nMe and room service, babe,\nMe and room service\nWell, we're living a life of sin When I ain't drinking, baby,\nYou are on my mind,\nWhen I ain't sleeping, honey,\nWhen I ain't sleeping, Mama,\nWhen I ain't sleeping\nWell you know you'll find me crying. Catch a boat to England, baby,\nMaybe to Spain,\nWherever I have gone,\nWherever I've been and gone,\nWherever I have gone\nThe blues have run the game. Living is a gamble, baby,\nLoving's much the same,\nWherever I have played,\nWherever I throw those dice,\nWherever I have played\nThe blues have run the game. Maybe when I'm older, baby,\nSomeplace down the line,\nI'll wake up older,\nSo much older, Mama,\nWake up older\nAnd I'll just stop all my trying. Catch a boat to England, baby,\nMaybe to Spain,\nWherever I have gone,\nWherever I've been and gone,\nWherever I have gone\nThe blues, they're all the same. The first thing I remember\nI was lying in my bed\nI couldn't of been no more\nThan one or two\nI remember there's a radio\nComin' from the room next door\nAnd my mother laughed\nThe way some ladies do\nWhen it's late in the evening\nAnd the music's seeping through The next thing I remember\nI am walking down the street\nI'm feeling all right\nI'm with my boys\nI'm with my troops, yeah\nAnd down along the avenue\nSome guys were shooting pool\nAnd I heard the sound\nOf a cappella groups, yeah\nSinging late in the evening\nAnd all the girls out on the stoops, yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar\nI was underage in this funky bar\nAnd I stepped outside to smoke myself a \"J\"\nAnd when I came back to the room\nEverybody just seemed to move\nAnd I turned my amp up loud and I began to play\nAnd it was late in the evening\nAnd I blew that room away The first thing I remember\nWhen you came into my life\nI said I'm gonna get that girl\nNo matter what I do\nWell I guess I'd been in love before\nAnd once or twice I been on the floor\nBut I never loved no one\nThe way that I loved you\nAnd it was late in the evening\nAnd all the music seeping through Celia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please to come home Celia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please to come home\nCome on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia\nUp in my bedroom (making love)\nI got up to wash my face\nWhen I come back to bed\nSomeone's taken my place Celia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please to come home\nCome on home Jubilation,\nShe loves me again,\nI fall on the floor and I laughing, Jubilation,\nShe loves me again,\nI fall on the floor and I'm laughing After I died, and the makeup had dried\nI went back to my place\nNo moon that night\nBut a heavenly light shone on my face Still I thought it was odd\nThere was no sign of God just to usher me in\nThen a voice from above\nSugar coated with love, said, \"Let us begin\" You got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line\nYou got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line Okay, a new kid in school\nGot to follow the rule\nYou got to learn the routine\nWoah, there's a girl over there\nWith the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen I said, \"Hey, what you say?\nIt's a glorious day,\nBy the way how long you been dead?\"\nMaybe you, maybe me\nMaybe baby makes three\nBut she just shook her head You got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line\nYou got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat\nHad to stand in the line\nJust to glimpse the divine\nWhat you think about that? Well it seems like our fate to suffer\nAnd wait for the knowledge we seek\nIt's all his design, no one cuts in the line\nNo one here, likes a sneak You got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line\nYou got to fill out a form first\nAnd then you wait in the line After you climb, up the ladder of time\nThe Lord God is here\nFace to face, in the vastness of space\nYour words disappear And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,\nAnd the current is strong\nBut all that remains when you\nTry to explain is a fragment of song Lord is it, be bop a lu la\nOr ooh poppa do\nLord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do\nBe bop a lu la It was a slow day\nAnd the sun was beating\nOn the soldiers by the side of the road\nThere was a bright light\nA shattering of shop windows\nThe bomb in the baby carriage\nWas wired to the radio These are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all The way we look to a distant constellation\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry\nDon't cry It was a dry wind\nAnd it swept across the desert\nAnd it curled into the circle of birth\nAnd the dead sand\nFalling on the children\nThe mothers and the fathers\nAnd the automatic earth These are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all, oh yeah The way we look to a distant constellation\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry\nDon't cry It's a turn-around jump shot\nIt's everybody jump start\nIt's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts\nMedicine is magical and magical is art\nThe boy in the bubble\nAnd the baby with the baboon heart And I believe\nThese are the days of lasers in the jungle\nLasers in the jungle somewhere\nStaccato signals of constant information\nA loose affiliation of millionaires\nAnd billionaires and baby These are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all, oh yeah The way we look to a distant constellation\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry\nDon't cry, don't cry Many's the time I've been mistaken\nAnd many times confused\nYes, and often felt forsaken\nAnd certainly misused\nBut I'm all right, I'm all right\nI'm just weary to my bones\nStill, you don't expect to be\nBright and bon vivant\nSo far away from home, so far away from home And I don't know a soul who's not been battered\nI don't have a friend who feels at ease\nI don't know a dream that's not been shattered\nor driven to its knees\nBut it's all right, it's all right\nWe've lived so well so long\nStill, when I think of the road\nwe're traveling on\nI wonder what went wrong\nI can't help it, I wonder what went wrong And I dreamed I was dying\nAnd I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly\nAnd looking back down at me\nSmiled reassuringly\nAnd I dreamed I was flying\nAnd high up above my eyes could clearly see\nThe Statue of Liberty\nSailing away to sea\nAnd I dreamed I was flying We come on the ship they call the Mayflower\nWe come on the ship that sailed the moon\nWe come in the age's most uncertain hour\nand sing an American tune\nBut it's all right, it's all right\nYou can't be forever blessed\nStill, tomorrow's going to be another working day\nAnd I'm trying to get some rest\nThat's all I'm trying to get some rest Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends\nA newspaper blowin' through the grass\nFalls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends Old friends, winter companions, the old men\nLost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun\nThe sounds of the city sifting through trees\nSettles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly\nHow terribly strange to be seventy Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears Well I'm accustomed to a smooth ride\nOr maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite\nI don't expect to be treated like a fool no more\nI don't expect to sleep through the night\nSome people say a lie's a lie's a lie\nBut I say why\nWhy deny the obvious child?\nWhy deny the obvious child? And in remembering a road sign\nI am remembering a girl when I was young\nAnd we said these songs are true\nThese days are ours\nThese tears are free\nAnd hey\nThe cross is in the ballpark\nThe cross is in the ballpark We had a lot of fun\nWe had a lot of money\nWe had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny\nSonny gets married and moves away\nSonny has a baby and bills to pay\nSonny gets sunnier\nDay by day by day by day I've been waking up at sunrise\nI've been following the light across my room\nI watch the night receive the room of my day\nSome people say the sky is just the sky\nBut I say\nWhy deny the obvious child?\nWhy deny the obvious child? Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself\nHow it's strange that some roots are like cages\nSonny's yearbook from high school\nIs down on the shelf\nAnd he idle thumbs through the pages\nSome have died\nSome have fled from themselves\nOr struggled from here to get there\nSonny wanders beyond his interior walls\nRuns his hands through his thinning brown hair\nI'm accustomed to a smoother ride\nOr maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite\nI don't expect to be treated like a fool no more\nI don't expect to sleep the night\nSome people say a lie is just a lie\nBut I say\nThe cross is in the ballpark\nWhy deny the obvious child? I hear the drizzle of the rain\nLike a memory it falls\nSoft and warm continuing\nTapping on my roof and walls. And from the shelter of my mind\nThrough the window of my eyes\nI gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets\nTo England where my heart lies. My mind's distracted and diffused\nMy thoughts are many miles away\nThey lie with you when you're asleep\nAnd kiss you when you start your day. And a song I was writing is left undone\nI don't know why I spend my time\nWriting songs I can't believe\nWith words that tear and strain to rhyme. And so you see I have come to doubt\nAll that I once held as true\nI stand alone without beliefs\nThe only truth I know is you.

you again,\nBecause a vision softly creeping,\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping,\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone,\n'Neath the halo of a street lamp,\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking,\nPeople hearing without listening,\nPeople writing songs that voices never share\nAnd no one dare\nDisturb the sound of silence \"Fools\" said I, \"You do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you,\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell,\nAnd echoed\nIn the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon God they made\nAnd the sign flashed its warning,\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said, \"The words of the prophets\nAre written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\"\nAnd whispered in the sounds of silence And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson\nJesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)\nGod bless you please, Mrs. Robinson\nHeaven holds a place for those who pray\n(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) We'd like to know a little bit about you for our

love, Thelma If the heart is an open memory book\nThat was the chance I took\nThe more I searched\nThe more I shook for Thelma Last night I slept on a rented pillow\nA silver moon above my head\nA thirsty dreamless sleep released me\nAnd I reached for the phone by the side of the bed Now the first time that I saw you I thought\nShe's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught\nPeople aware of my history\nTrying to steer you away from me\nI left a message at your hotel\nDon't let management poison the well I will need you, feed you,\nSeed you, plead with you\nAll for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma The phone is ringing and I realize\nWe are time zones and oceans apart\nThe words I speak in the middle of my night\nFall on your yesterday's heart If the sun don't shine\nIf the wind don't break\nIf the clock don't jump off the wall\nThelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall I will need you, feed you,\nSeed you, plead with you\nWithout the taste of your sweet love, Thelma\nI am only a man who skirted the edge of despair\nFor a long time, now\nAnd I don't care I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed\nThe baby curled up in a ball\nWinter sunlight hits the family tree\nAnd everything else becomes nothing at all It was the morning of October 6th, 1960\nI was wearing my brown suit\nPreparing to leave the house of D.\nShook some hands then adios Brooklyn amigos\nMaybe some of them had hopes of seeing me again\nSome even said that my judge Judge Gerald Culkin\nWouldn't play it by the book\nMaybe let us off the hook\nBut wooo I knew better Salvador\nAfraid to leave the projects\nTo cross into another neighborhood\nThe blancos and the nigger gangs\nWell they'd kill us if they could Aurea & Women\nAngel of Mercy, people are suffering\nAll over the world\nSpanish children are taught on their knees to believe\nAngel of Mercy, people are suffering\nAll over the island tonight\nMothers weep, sisters grieve Sal\nWell, I entered the courtroom, state of New York\nCounty of New York, just some spic\nThey scrubbed off the sidewalk\nGuilty by my dress\nGuilty in the press\nLet the Capeman burn for the murders Salvador\nThe 'Spanish boys' had their day in court room Sal\nAnd now it was time for some fuckin' law and order\n\"The electric chair\nFor the greasy pair?\"\nSaid the judge to the court reporter Salvador\nAfraid to leave the projects\nTo cross into another neighborhood\nThe newspapers and the TV crews\nWell they'd kill you if they could Aurea & Women\nAngel of Mercy, well people are suffering\nAll over the world Sal\nA Spanish boy could be killed every night of the week\nBut just let some white boy die\nAnd the world goes crazy for blood--latin blood\nI don't lie when i speak Sal & Salvador\nWell they shackled my hands\nA heavy belt around my waist to restrain me Sal\nAnd they shackled my legs\nHernandez, the \"Umbrella Man\" chained beside me\nThen we rode that black mariah trough the streets of Spanish Harlem Salvador\nCalling old friends on the corners\nJust to lay our prayers upon them Crying adios pisanos, adios\nAdios pisanos, adios You got to learn how to fall\nBefore you learn to fly\nAnd mama, mama it ain't no lie\nBefore you learn to fly\nLearn how to fall You got to drift in the breeze\nBefore you set your sails\nIt's an occupation where the wind prevails\nBefore you set your sails\nDrift in the breeze Oh and it's the same old story\nEver since the world began\nEverybody got the runs for glory\nNobody stop and scrutinize the plan\nNobody stop and scrutinize the plan You got to learn how to fall\nBefore you learn to fly\nThe tank towns they tell no lie\nBefore you learn to fly\nLearn how to fall Hello darkness, my old friend\nI've come to talk with you again\nBecause a vision softly creeping\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\n'Neath the halo of a street lamp\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople hearing without listening\nPeople writing songs that voices never share\nAnd no one dared\nDisturb the sound of silence \"Fools\", said I, \"You do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words, like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed\nIn the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said, \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\"\nAnd whispered in the sounds of silence Over the mountain\nDown in the valley\nLives a former talk-show host\nEverybody knows his name He says there's no doubt about it\nIt was the myth of fingerprints\nI've seen them all and man\nThey're all the same Well, the sun gets weary\nAnd the sun goes down\nEver since the watermelon\nAnd the lights come up On the black pit town\nSomebody says what's a better thing to do\nWell, it's not just me\nAnd it's not just you This is all around the world Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere\nThere's a former army post\nAbandoned now just like the war\nAnd there's no doubt about it\nIt was the myth of fingerprints\nThat's what that old army post was for Well, the sun gets bloody\nAnd the sun goes down\nEver since the watermelon\nAnd the lights come up On the black pit town\nSomebody says what's a better thing to do\nWell, it's not just me\nAnd it's not just you This is all around the world Over the mountain\nDown in the valley\nLives the former talk-show host\nFar and wide his name was known\nHe said there's no doubt about it\nIt was the myth of fingerprints\nThat's why we must learn to live alone Down among the reeds and rushes\nA baby boy was found\nHis eyes as clear as centuries\nHis silky hair was brown Never been lonely\nNever been lied to\nNever had to scuffle in fear\nNothing denied to\nBorn at the instant\nThe church bells chime\nAnd the whole world whispering\nBorn at the right time Me and my buddies we are traveling people\nWe like to go down to restaurant row\nSpend those Euro-dollars\nAll the way from Washington to Tokyo\nI see them in the airport lounge\nUpon their mother's breast\nThey follow me with open eyes\nTheir uninvited guest Never been lonely\nNever been lied to\nNever had to scuffle in fear\nNothing denied to\nBorn at the instant\nThe church bells chime\nAnd the whole world whispering\nBorn at the right time Too many people on the bus from the airport\nToo many holes in the crust of the earth\nThe planet groans\nEvery time it registers another birth But down among the reeds and rushes\nA baby girl was found\nHer eyes as clear as centuries\nHer silky hair was brown Never been lonely\nNever been lied to\nNever had to scuffle in fear\nNothing denied to\nBorn at the instant\nThe church bells chime\nAnd the whole world whispering\nBorn at the right time No I would not give you false hope\nOn this strange and mournful day\nBut the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I can't for the life of me\nRemember a sadder day\nI know they say let it be\nBut it just don't work out that way\nAnd the course of a lifetime runs\nOver and over again No I would not give you false hope\nOn this strange and mournful day\nBut the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I just can't believe it's so\nThough it seems strange to say\nI never been laid so low\nIn such a mysterious way\nAnd the course of a lifetime runs\nOver and over again But I would not give you false hope\nOn this strange and mournful day\nWhen the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away Oh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away\nOh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away\nOh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a motion away\nOh the mother and child reunion\nIs only a moment away Went to my doctor yesterday\nShe said I seem to be

Papa, oh!\nSee what I have seen\nThere's a mean individual stranded in a limousine Then everybody came running\nEverybody said Lord, Lord!\nEverybody was gunning\nThey're gonna divvy up the reward\nAnd then a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah\nA siren, a flashing light\nBut the mean individual\nHad vanished in the black of night Hey hey hey hey\nThey wondered where to begin\n'Cause he left that neighborhood\nJust like the rattlesnake sheds its skin Well they searched the roofs\nAnd they checked out the groups\nAnd they photographed the scene\nFor the mean individual\nStranded in a limousine Then everybody came running\nEverybody said Lord, Lord!\nEverybody was gunning\nThey're gonna divvy up the reward\nAnd then a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah\nA siren, a flashing light\nBut the mean individual\nHad vanished in the black of night\nThe mean individual had vanished in the black of night\nThe mean individual had vanished in the black of night!

counted every falling star I believe a light that shines on you\nWill shine on you forever\nAnd though I cant guarantee\nThere's nothing scary hiding under your bed\nI'm gonna stand guard like a postcard\nAt the Golden Retriever\nAnd never leave till I leave you\nWith a sweet dream in your bed Chorus:\nI'm gonna watch you shine\nGonna watch you grow\nGonna paint a sign\nSo you'll always

get a bite\nYou don't need to waste your time\nWorryin' about the market place\nTrying to help the human race\nStrugglin to survive its harshest hour chorus\nx2 There's been some hard feelings here\nAbout some words that were said\nThere's been some hard feelings here\nAnd what is more\nThere's been a bloody purple nose\nAnd some bloody purple clothes\nThat were messing up the lobby floor\nIt's just apartment house rules\nSo all you 'partment fools\nRemember: one man's ceiling\nIs another man's floor\nRemember: one man's ceiling\nIs another man's floor There's been some strange goin's on\nAnd some folks have come and gone\nAnd the elevator man don't work no more\nI heard a racket in the hall\nAnd I thought I heard a fall\nBut I never opened up my door\nIt's just apartment house sense\nIt's like apartment rents\nRemember: one man's ceiling\nIs another man's floor\nRemember: one man's ceiling\nIs another man's floor And there's an alley\nIn the back of my building\nWhere some people congregate in shame\nI was walking with my dog\nAnd the night was black with smog\nWhen I thought I heard somebody\nCall my name The first time I heard \u00e2??Peggy Sue\u00e2??\nI was 12 years old\nRussians up in rocket ships\nAnd the war was cold\nNow many wars have come and gone\nGenocide still goes on\nBuddy Holly still goes on\nBut his catalog was sold First time I smoked\nGuess what, paranoid\nFirst time I heard \u00e2??Satisfaction\u00e2??\nI was young and unemployed\nDown the decades every year\nSummer leaves and my birthday's here\nAnd all my friends stand up and cheer\nAnd say Man you're old\nGetting old\nOld\nGetting old We celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas day\nAnd Buddha found nirvana along the lotus way\nAbout 1,500 years ago the messenger Mohammad spoke\nAnd his wisdom like a river flowed\nThrough hills of gold\nWisdom is old\nThe Koran is old\nThe Bible's old\nGreatest story ever told Disagreements?\nWork 'em out The human race has walked the earth for 2.7 million\nAnd we estimate the universe at 13-14 billion\nWhen all these numbers tumble into your imagination\nConsider that the Lord was there before creation\nGod is old\nWe're not old\nGod is old\nHe made the mold Take your clothes off\nAdam and Eve Moves like a fist through traffic\nAnger and no one can heal it\nShoves a little bump into the momentum\nIt's just a little lump\nBut you feel it\nIn the creases and the shadows\nWith a rattling deep emotion\nThe cool, cool river\nSweeps the wild, white ocean Yes boss, the government handshake\nYes boss, the crusher of language\nYes boss, Mr. Stillwater\nThe face at the edge of the banquet\nThe cool, the cool river\nThe cool, the cool river I believe in the future\nI may live in my car\nMy radio tuned to\nThe voice of a star\nSong dogs barking at the break of dawn\nLightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm\nAnd these old hopes and fears\nStill at my side Anger and no one can heal it\nSlides through the metal detector\nLives like a mole in a motel\nA slide in a slide projector\nThe cool, cool river\nSweeps the wild, white ocean\nThe rage of love turns inward\nTo prayers of devotion\nAnd these prayers are\nThe constant road across the wilderness\nThese prayers are\nThese prayers are the memory of God\nThe memory of God And I believe in the future\nWe shall suffer no more\nMaybe not in my lifetime\nBut in yours I feel sure\nSong dogs barking at the break of dawn\nLightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm\nAnd these streets\nQuiet as a sleeping army\nSend their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven\nFor the mother's restless son\nWho is a witness to, who is a warrior\nWho denies his urge to break and run Who says: Hard times?\nI'm used to them\nThe speeding planet burns\nI'm used to that\nMy life's so common it disappears\nAnd sometimes even music\nCannot substitute for tears Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary & thyme\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of mine Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)\nParsely, sage, rosemary & thyme\n(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)\nWithout no seams nor needlework\n(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)\nThen she'll be a true love of mine\n(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)\nTell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)\nParsely, sage, rosemary, & thyme\n(Washed is the ground with so many tears)\nBetween the salt water and the sea strand\n(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)\nThen she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)\nParsely, sage, rosemary & thyme\n(Generals order their soldiers to kill)\nAnd to gather it all in a bunch of heather\n(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)\nThen she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary & thyme\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of mine. We sailed up a river wide as a sea\nAnd slept on the banks\nOn the leaves of a banyan tree\nAnd all of these spirit voices rule the night Some stories are magical, meant to be sung\nSongs from the mouth of the river\nWhen the world was young\nAnd all of these spirit voices rule the night By moon\nWe walk\nTo the brujo's door\nAlong a path of river stone\nWomen with their nursing children\nSeated on the floor\nWe join the fevers\nAnd the broken bones The candlelight flickers\nThe falcon calls\nA lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall\nAnd all of these spirit voices\nSing rainwater, sea water\nRiver water, holy water\nWrap this child in mercy \u00e2?? heal her\nHeaven's only daughter\nAll of these spirit voices rule the night My hands are numb\nMy feet were lead\nI drank a cup of herbal brew\nThe sweetness in the air\nCombined with the lightness in my head\nAnd I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo Saudocoes -- Greetings!\nDa licenca um momento -- Excuse me, one moment\nTe lembro -- I remind you\nQue amanha -- That tomorrow\nSera tudo ou sera naoa -- It will be all or it will be nothing\nDepende coracao -- It depends, heart\nSera breve ou sera grande -- It will be brief or it will be great\nDepende da paixao -- It depends on the passion\nSera sujo, sera sonho -- It will be dirty, it will be a dream\nCuidado, coracao -- Be careful, heart\nSera util, sera tarde -- It will be useful, it will be late\nSe esmera, coracao -- Do your best, heart\nE confia -- And have trust\nNa forca do amanha -- In the power of tomorrow Lord of the earthquake\nMy trembling bed\nThe spider resumes the rhythm\nOf his golden tread\nAnd all of these spirit voices rule the night He was my brother\nFive years older than I\nHe was my brother\nTwenty-three Years old the day he died Freedom writer\nThey cursed my brother to his face\nGo home outsider\nThis town's gonna be your buryin' place He was singin' on his knees\nAn angry mob trailed along\nThey shot my brother dead\nBecause he hated what was wrong He was my brother\nTears can't bring him back to me\nHe was my brother\nAnd he died so his brothers could be free\nHe died so his brothers could be free Begin again\nNo easy trick\nWithout a guide or walking stick\nBegin before the bells of twilight peal\nDownhill town\nThe road ahead\nSpiral, as a serpent's bed\nA teaspoon of desire for my meal I trade my tears\nTo ask the Lord\nFor proof of love\nIf only for the consolation\nOf gazing at the stars above\nAmen, amen, amen\nThe road is steep\nThe air is thin\nI hear a voice inside my skin\nDon't be afraid Your days won't end with night\nFeel the sun\nDrink the rain\nLet your body heal its pain\nBathe beneath a waterfall of light\nI trade my tears\nTo ask the Lord\nFor proof of love If only for the explanation\nThat tells me what my dreams are made of\nAmen, amen\nThe valley below\nAn ocean of debris\nI ask the Lord\nFor proof of love\nLove is all I seek\nLove is all I seek And when at times my words desert me\nMusic is the tongue I speak\nI rest my head beside a white oak tree\nNo deadly nightshade, Belladonna\nDare lay a leaf on me\nSilent night\nStill as prayer\nDarkness fills with light\nLove on Earth is everywhere I was having this discussion\nIn a taxi heading downtown\nRearranging my position\nOn this friend of mine who had A little bit of a breakdown\nI said breakdowns come\nAnd breakdowns go\nSo what are you going to do about it That's what I'd like to know\nYou don't feel you could love me\nBut I feel you could It was in the early morning hours\nWhen I fell into a phone call\nBelieving I had supernatural powers\nI slammed into a brick wall I said hey, is this my problem?\nIs this my fault?\nIf that's the way it's going to be\nI'm going to call the whole thing to a halt You don't feel you could love me\nBut I feel you could\nYou don't feel you could love me\nBut I feel you could I was walking down the street\nWhen I thought I heard this voice say\nSay, ain't we walking down the same street together\nOn the very same day I said hey Senorita that's astute\nI said why don't we get together\nAnd call ourselves an institute You don't feel you could love me\nBut I feel you could\nYou don't feel you could love me\nBut I feel you could -
