love began\nThinkin' of a million ways\nTo escape and be with you\nBut reality wasn't just you and I\nIt was long drawn out days and lonely nights Dreamin' bout you\nI keep dreamin' bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin' bout when you would say [Chorus]\nLet me take you to another place\nWhere nothing ever seems to matter\nIts just you and me\nWe can take flight like a thief in the night\nStolen moments with you (oh oh) Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)\nI was just a girl and you a young man\nHow could age define\nSomething so divine (so divine)\nCan this even be real or just exist in my mind Dreamin' bout you\nI keep dreamin' 'bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say [Chorus] Dreamin' bout you\nI keep dreamin' bout you\nWhen I'm dreamin and waiting for the day\nWhen no one and nothing else takes up our time\nFinally you're only mine Each and everyday\nI don't walk with you right by my side\nBut instead we have to hide\nSneak around and lie\nJust to spend time alone\nThis lovin is a crime\nI'd rather do the time\nAnd leave the world behind [Chorus] Let's get away\nLet's get away\nOh oh We can get away\nWe can get away\nOh oh Let's get away\nLet's get away\nOh oh We can get away\nWe can get away\nOh oh Look around, look around at how lucky we are\nTo be alive right now\nLook around, look around Look around, look around at how lucky we are\nTo be alive right now\nLook around, look around Look at where you are\nLook at where you started\nThe fact that you're alive is a miracle\nJust stay alive\nThat would be enough And if this child\nShares a fraction of your smile\nOr a fragment of your mind, look out world!\nThat would be enough I don't pretend to know\nThe challenges you're facing\nThe worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid\nI know who I married\nSo long as you come home at the end of the day\nThat would be enough We don't need a legacy\nWe don't need money\nIf I could grant you peace of mind\nIf you could let me inside your heart Oh, let me be a part of the narrative\nIn the story they will write someday\nLet this moment be the first chapter:\nWhere you decide to stay And I would be enough\nAnd this could be enough\nThis would be enough Said, I would be enough\nAnd this could be enough\nSee, we could be enough\nOh baby I could be enough\nWe could be enough\nThis could be enough\nOoh Don't look no further\nDon't go nowhere\nI could be enough (I could be enough)\nWe could have it all Tell me baby (baby)\nCan you feel me?
